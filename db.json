Confirms End Of SEC Case\r\n\r\nRipple Cheers As Gary Gensler Exits SEC Leadership\r\n\r\nby\r\n\r\nChristian Encila\r\n\r\n3 months ago\r\n\r\n·\r\n\r\nPosted in\r\n\r\nXRP\r\n\r\nTrusted Editorial\r\n\r\ncontent, reviewed by leading industry experts and seasoned editors.\r\n\r\nAd Disclosure\r\n\r\nRipple has much to celebrate following the announcement of resignation of Gary Gensler as Chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\r\n\r\nRelated Reading:\r\n\r\nFDIC Under Fire: Senator Alleges Destruction Of Operation Chokepoint 2.0 Records\r\n\r\nThe recent upheaval at the SEC may indicate a shift in the protracted dispute between Ripple Labs and the SEC about the classification of\r\n\r\nXRP.\r\n\r\nRipple’s legal team has conveyed confidence regarding prospective alterations in the SEC’s position, particularly with the prospect of a more cryptocurrency-friendly CEO at the helm.\r\n\r\nA New Chapter In Ripple’s Legal Dispute\r\n\r\nThe news that Gensler was leaving was a surprise, but for Ripple, it marks a positive opportunity. Legal counsel for Ripple has continuously criticized Gensler’s forceful stance on cryptocurrency regulation, particularly with regard to XRP’s designation as a\r\n\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\nGary Gensler’s controversial time as Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) came to an end on Friday when he formally resigned.\r\n\r\nStuart Alderoty\r\n\r\n, the Chief Legal Officer at Ripple, made fun of Gensler’s departure on social media site X, claiming that the cryptocurrency community would quickly forget him.\r\n\r\nToday marks Gensler’s last full day. Starting tomorrow, ‘Gary who?’ will be the only appropriate response if someone mentions his name. Onward.\r\n\r\n— Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty)\r\n\r\nJanuary 17, 2025\r\n\r\nMany inside the cryptocurrency community expect a shift in regulatory stance as Paul Atkins emerges as a potential replacement.\r\n\r\nSince they argue that a new SEC chair might ease tensions and reduce regulatory risks related to digital assets, Ripple’s lawyers see this as a potential opportunity for more favorable treatment.\r\n\r\nXRP is currently trading at $3.1. Chart:\r\n\r\nTradingView\r\n\r\nSEC’s Contentious Strategy Under Gensler\r\n\r\nUnder Gensler, the SEC gained a bad reputation for treating cryptocurrencies negatively. Many objected that the present state of affairs just reflected the inconsistency defining his leadership since the agency’s strategy seems unfavorable for the developing industry.\r\n\r\nRipple and other crypto advocates have expressed frustration with the SEC’s litigation and perceived ambiguity in cryptocurrency regulation. With Gensler set to retire, the discussion has increasingly turned to how a new SEC chair could change the landscape.\r\n\r\nAnother example of how\r\n\r\n@GaryGensler\r\n\r\nis leaving the\r\n\r\n@SECGov\r\n\r\nin disgrace. The reputation of the SEC, both inside and outside the courtroom, is in complete shambles.Paul Atkins has his work cut out for him.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to witness real reform at the SEC.

He said that the SEC was a mess when Gensler was in charge and that the exit is a big chance for things to get better.\r\n\r\nDeaton says that the SEC has been going too far in its efforts to regulate cryptocurrencies, and many people in the business are questioning its methods.

This includes things like the video editing app CapCut, but as gamers\r\n        learned late on Sunday, it also includes…Marvel Snap?</p>\r\n    <div class=\"halfway_hardwall_1\"></div>\r\n    <div class=\"article_paragraph_2\"></div>\r\n    <p>Marvel Snap is a digital card game developed by Second Dinner, so how did it catch a stray here? Well, ByteDance\r\n        was the publisher of Marvel Snap. There was a somewhat ugly situation back in 2023 when ByteDance divested from\r\n        its gaming Nuverse subsidiary as part of a “restructure” of its gaming business. However, Marvel Snap has\r\n        continued to operate since then, despite ByteDance’s exit, but it seems they are still technically be the\r\n        publisher in order for this to be happening.</p>\r\n    <div class=\"halfway_hardwall_2\"></div>\r\n    <p>But whatever is going on here, they took Snap offline ahead of the company ban with these other apps, despite\r\n        supposedly getting out of the gaming business. When players try to log in, they are greeted with a\r\n        nearly-identical message that TikTokers are being shown which reads:</p>\r\n    <div class=\"halfway_hardwall_3\"></div>\r\n    \r\n    <p>“Sorry MARVEL SNAP isn’t available right now.</p>\r\n    <div class=\"halfway_hardwall_4\"></div>\r\n    <p>A law banning MARVEL SNAP has been enacted in the US. Unfortunately, that means you can’t use MARVEL SNAP for\r\n        now. Rest assured, we’re working to restore our service in the US.”</p>\r\n    \r\n    <figure class=\"embed-base image-embed embed-1\" role=\"presentation\">\r\n        <img\r\n                    src=\"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/678c8d342e92d76e45ebfa20/snap/960x0.png?format=png&amp;width=1440\"\r\n                    alt=\"snap\" style=\"display: block;\">\r\n    </figure>\r\n   <br>\r\n    <p>Unlike a variant of the TikTok message, there is no mention of incoming President Donald Trump, who ByteDance\r\n        believes will work out a deal with them to get TikTok back online in the US. And if that happens, then all these\r\n        other apps would repopulate including Marvel Snap, presumably.</p>\r\n    <p>It’s a deeply strange situation as most players probably didn’t know ByteDance had anything to do with Marvel\r\n        Snap, as the face of the game is the California-based studio Second Dinner.

This includes things like the video editing app CapCut, but as gamers learned late on Sunday, it also includes…Marvel Snap?\r\n\r\nMarvel Snap is a digital card game developed by Second Dinner, so how did it catch a stray here? Well, ByteDance was the publisher of Marvel Snap. There was a somewhat ugly situation back in 2023 when ByteDance divested from its gaming Nuverse subsidiary as part of a “restructure” of its gaming business. However, Marvel Snap has continued to operate since then, despite ByteDance’s exit, but it seems they are still technically be the publisher in order for this to be happening.\r\n\r\nBut whatever is going on here, they took Snap offline ahead of the company ban with these other apps, despite supposedly getting out of the gaming business. When players try to log in, they are greeted with a nearly-identical message that TikTokers are being shown which reads:\r\n\r\n“Sorry MARVEL SNAP isn’t available right now.\r\n\r\nA law banning MARVEL SNAP has been enacted in the US. Unfortunately, that means you can’t use MARVEL SNAP for now. Rest assured, we’re working to restore our service in the US.”\r\n\r\nThe message\r\n\r\nMarvel Snap\r\n\r\nMORE FOR YOU\r\n\r\nDo Not Make Calls On Your Phone If You Get This Message\r\n\r\nGmail Hack — Google Warns Users Have 7 Days To Act\r\n\r\nU.S. Futures And Asian Markets Rise After Trump Suggests China Tariffs Will ‘Come Down Substantially’\r\n\r\nUnlike a variant of the TikTok message, there is no mention of incoming President Donald Trump, who ByteDance believes will work out a deal with them to get TikTok back online in the US. And if that happens, then all these other apps would repopulate including Marvel Snap, presumably.\r\n\r\nIt’s a deeply strange situation as most players probably didn’t know ByteDance had anything to do with Marvel Snap, as the face of the game is the California-based studio Second Dinner. Again, ByteDance supposedly divested from Nuverse and Snap, but it’s still tangled up in the web somehow.\r\n\r\nI’m currently looking into other games that may be affected by this ban, based on Nuverse or other ByteDance subsidiary projects. Some of those games like Warhammer 40,000: Lost Crusade have already shut down, and Marvel Snap so far seems like the highest profile game to catch a stray from this whole situation.\r\n\r\nEssentially if TikTok comes back, Marvel Snap comes back. It’s an additionally complicated situation because it was easy to spend dozens, hundreds or even thousands of dollars on Snap if you were a big enough fan, and now that’s just…gone? While TikTok is the biggest story here, certainly, this is a thoroughly unexpected and bizarre development in the gaming world, and we’ll be tracking it as it continues to unfold.\r\n\r\nFollow me\r\n\r\non Twitter\r\n\r\n,\r\n\r\nYouTube\r\n\r\n,\r\n\r\nBluesky\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\nInstagram\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nPick up my sci-fi novels the\r\n\r\nHerokiller series\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\nThe Earthborn Trilogy\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nEditorial Standards\r\n\r\nForbes Accolades\r\n\r\nLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...\r\n\r\nFORBES’ FEATURED Video\r\n\r\n© 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

new batch of ETFs seeks to offer up to 100% downside protection.\r\n\r\nBy\r\n\r\nAndré Beganski\r\n\r\nJan 21, 2025\r\n\r\nJan 21, 2025\r\n\r\n3 min read\r\n\r\nBitcoin.

The product’s so-called cap range, expected to be anywhere between 10% to 11.5%, will be struck at the end of the day. From that point on, the ETF will aim to offer 100% downside protection against Bitcoin’s price, with a cap range struck again next year.\r\n\r\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs debuted in the U.S. last year, notching $36.2 billion worth of net inflows as investors and traders\r\n\r\nflocked\r\n\r\nto products from Wall Street giants like Fidelity and BlackRock. Since then, Bitcoin’s price has climbed 133% from $46,000 to nearly\r\n\r\n$107,000\r\n\r\n, yet\r\n\r\nsome analysts say\r\n\r\nthat registered investment advisors and wirehouses are still warming up to such products.\r\n\r\nAmong institutional investors, 48% of those surveyed in 2023 said that digital assets’ price volatility was a considerable obstacle from an investment standpoint—citing that factor more than anything else, according to a Fidelity Digital Assets\r\n\r\nreport\r\n\r\n. Meanwhile, 22% of respondents pointed to\r\n\r\nself-custody\r\n\r\nconcerns, which spot ETFs largely availed.\r\n\r\nIn two weeks, Calamos—which was founded in 1977—will launch additional ETFs with 80% and 90% downside protection against Bitcoin. Those products will have an estimated cap range of 28% to 31% and 50% to 55%, respectively.\r\n\r\nThe products’ risk management framework will be achieved through a combination of U.S. Treasuries and flex options on the CBOE Bitcoin US ETF Index, according to Calamos’\r\n\r\nwebsite\r\n\r\n. Flex options are essentially customizable exchange-listed options, which can have a one-year outcome period, as opposed to expiring on the final Friday of each month, Kaufman said.\r\n\r\nCalamos, which has $40 billion in assets under management, launched similar products covering the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 last year.\r\n\r\nThough the products could find use among a professional investment crowd, Kaufman posited that the products could also cater to investors beyond the typical age of your typical crypto bro.\r\n\r\n“The adoption for Bitcoin has been on the individual or retail level, and it's largely been people younger than myself,” the 45-year-old Kaufman said. “We haven't seen too much of the adoption curve from those older investors, largely because of the risk tolerance that they just can't take.”\r\n\r\nEdited by\r\n\r\nAndrew Hayward", "tags": [20]}}, {"model": "blog.article", "pk": 58, "fields": {"title": "Startup founders flooded inauguration parties hopeful for dealmaking - TechCrunch", "author": "Margaux MacColl", "description": "All throughout America’s capital, founders enjoyed the fruits of their industry’s political jockeying.", "content": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\r\n    <p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Monday, while tech billionaires like Elon Musk and Mark\r\n        Zuckerberg sat onstage for President Donald Trump’s inauguration, dozens of founders were at parties all across\r\n        Washington, D.C., trying to get an audience with the new president’s inner circle.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To hear them tell it, it wasn’t all that hard. Valar Atomics founder Isaiah Taylor\r\n        spent the weekend party hopping, rubbing shoulders with Sean Spicer or conservative podcaster Jordan Peterson.\r\n        Taylor’s company wants to use nuclear power to generate synthetic hydrocarbon fuel. He even scored three\r\n        separate invites to Mar-a-Lago in the last month by sending a two-page document on changes he’d like to see to\r\n        nuclear regulations to anyone he knew with Washington connections. “People are like, ‘please tell me, how do we\r\n        fix this? We need to build things again,’” he said of the administration.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <br>\r\n\r\n\r\n    <p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His story was surprisingly common. All throughout America’s capital, founders enjoyed\r\n        the fruits of their industry’s political jockeying. They watched Snoop Dogg at David Sacks’ Crypto Ball,\r\n        attended a wee-hours crypto rave sponsored by the Milady NFT group, and dressed up for a “Coronation Ball”\r\n        hosted by a publishing company associated with Curtis Yarvin, the controversial thought leader <a\r\n            href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/18/magazine/curtis-yarvin-interview.html\" target=\"_blank\"\r\n            rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">cited by both</a> Marc Andreessen and Peter Thiel.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tyler Sweatt, CEO of defense tech startup Second Front Systems, said a huge\r\n        frustration he’s had with the federal government has been bureaucratic opacity. Founders often can’t even figure\r\n        out who<em> </em>to contact in the government, much less secure a huge contract.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Sweatt left events like the vice presidential dinner and Trump’s pre-inauguration\r\n        candlelight dinner feeling like the country might be entering a rare moment when the federal government, Big\r\n        Tech, and the startup ecosystem are aligned — and where the shroud surrounding the government’s inner workings\r\n        might be lifted. “Apolitically, that’s pretty freaking interesting for what could we do as a country,” he\r\n        said.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At a watch party hosted by conservative organization American Moment, the\r\n        congressional staffers wore suits with red ties and tech workers wore sneakers. Jacob Martin, general partner of\r\n        crypto fund 2 Punks Capital and co-founder of gaming guild Ready Player DAO, kept watching for news that Trump\r\n        had immediately pardoned Silk Road’s infamous founder Ross Ulbricht, currently serving life in prison. He did\r\n        not, despite having promised to <a\r\n            href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-failed-deliver-day-1-promise-grant-clemency-ross-ulbricht-founder-silk-road\"\r\n            target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">do so at a Libertarian convention in May.</a></p>\r\n\r\n    <p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Martin also lamented missing his chance to buy the Trump meme coin when it launched at\r\n        Sacks’ Crypto Ball, a time when top crypto donors were away from their computers. Trading on the coin soon\r\n        soared. “I could have bought. But I didn’t, because it was clearly a scam, right?” Martin laughed. “There were\r\n        people who made hundreds of millions on it.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <br>\r\n\r\n    <p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He hopes the Trump administration can make it so “people are able to utilize\r\n        blockchain technology to make better things, launch tokens when necessary, and not have to worry about jail\r\n        time.”&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-doge-as-their-big-chance\">DOGE as their big chance</h2>\r\n    <br>\r\n\r\n    <p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Several founders felt Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency will open the\r\n        floodgates for startups to pitch the government on their products in order to fulfill its promise of making the\r\n        government more efficient.

Valar Atomics founder Isaiah Taylor spent the weekend party hopping, rubbing shoulders with Sean Spicer or conservative podcaster Jordan Peterson. Taylor’s company wants to use nuclear power to generate synthetic hydrocarbon fuel. He even scored three separate invites to Mar-a-Lago in the last month by sending a two-page document on changes he’d like to see to nuclear regulations to anyone he knew with Washington connections. “People are like, ‘please tell me, how do we fix this? We need to build things again,’” he said of the administration.\r\n\r\nHis story was surprisingly common. All throughout America’s capital, founders enjoyed the fruits of their industry’s political jockeying. They watched Snoop Dogg at David Sacks’ Crypto Ball, attended a wee-hours crypto rave sponsored by the Milady NFT group, and dressed up for a “Coronation Ball” hosted by a publishing company associated with Curtis Yarvin, the controversial thought leader\r\n\r\ncited by both\r\n\r\nMarc Andreessen and Peter Thiel.\r\n\r\nTyler Sweatt, CEO of defense tech startup Second Front Systems, said a huge frustration he’s had with the federal government has been bureaucratic opacity. Founders often can’t even figure out who\r\n\r\nto contact in the government, much less secure a huge contract.\r\n\r\nBut Sweatt left events like the vice presidential dinner and Trump’s pre-inauguration candlelight dinner feeling like the country might be entering a rare moment when the federal government, Big Tech, and the startup ecosystem are aligned — and where the shroud surrounding the government’s inner workings might be lifted. “Apolitically, that’s pretty freaking interesting for what could we do as a country,” he said.\r\n\r\nAt a watch party hosted by conservative organization American Moment, the congressional staffers wore suits with red ties and tech workers wore sneakers. Jacob Martin, general partner of crypto fund 2 Punks Capital and co-founder of gaming guild Ready Player DAO, kept watching for news that Trump had immediately pardoned Silk Road’s infamous founder Ross Ulbricht, currently serving life in prison. He did not, despite having promised to\r\n\r\ndo so at a Libertarian convention in May.\r\n\r\nMartin also lamented missing his chance to buy the Trump meme coin when it launched at Sacks’ Crypto Ball, a time when top crypto donors were away from their computers. Trading on the coin soon soared. “I could have bought. But I didn’t, because it was clearly a scam, right?” Martin laughed. “There were people who made hundreds of millions on it.”\r\n\r\nHe hopes the Trump administration can make it so “people are able to utilize blockchain technology to make better things, launch tokens when necessary, and not have to worry about jail time.”\r\n\r\nDOGE as their big chance\r\n\r\nSeveral founders felt Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency will open the floodgates for startups to pitch the government on their products in order to fulfill its promise of making the government more efficient. James Layfield, chief sales officer of Samplify.ai, which helps companies identify redundant software, created a website called “DogeProof.com.” The concept, he said, is to offer up Samplify.ai’s products to government agencies for free so they can rid themselves of extraneous subscriptions before Musk comes along to slash their costs.\r\n\r\nLayfield pitched it to Florida representative Byron Donalds at an inauguration ball and said he seemed intrigued. “The whole experience has been incredibly rewarding to just see how open people are to this possibility,” Layfield said.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Rabi Alam, founder of Counter Health, hopes that DOGE might support his company’s mission to streamline the healthcare system while keeping the quality of care high. First, though, like everyone in the country, he’s got to figure out what exactly DOGE is. Luckily, Alam scored an invite to the Inauguration Ball, where he intended to scout some DOGE employees. “I’d like to get some of what I’ll call finer granularity and more color on what the approach is,” he said.\r\n\r\nIf this weekend shows anything, it’s that the hardest challenge founders will face, between balls and Mar-a-Lago trips, might just be staying focused on their day job. “There’s people who are trying to be in the right room,” Taylor said. “And there are people trying to get the work done.”\r\n\r\nTopics\r\n\r\ndoge\r\n\r\n,\r\n\r\nElon Musk\r\n\r\n,\r\n\r\nExclusive\r\n\r\n,\r\n\r\nMark Zuckerberg\r\n\r\n,\r\n\r\nStartups\r\n\r\n,\r\n\r\nTrump\r\n\r\nMargaux MacColl\r\n\r\nSenior Reporter\r\n\r\nMargaux is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

restore confidence in the world’s second-largest economy by telling local insurance companies and mutual funds to invest more in domestic stocks.\r\n\r\nRegulators have told state insurers to invest a minimum of 30 per cent of their new policy premiums in local shares, while mutual funds have been told to increase these shareholdings by 10 per cent annually for the next three years. This is the first time regulators have set an explicit target for investments.\r\n\r\nThe policy shift could mean that up to Rmb500bn ($68bn) could flow into the market from China’s three biggest state-owned insurers alone, according to a Financial Times analysis of last year’s policy premiums. Insurers already hold shares worth Rmb4.4tn, said regulators.\r\n\r\nThe mainland’s CSI 300 index rose as much as 1.8 per cent on Thursday, almost erasing losses incurred on Wednesday after the new US administration threatened tariffs on Chinese exports.\r\n\r\nGeopolitical tensions, a cooling economy and a property market crisis have in recent years hit demand for\r\n\r\nChinese equities\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nThe latest move, first announced on Wednesday evening by regulators including the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the People’s Bank of China, aims to “stabilise the stock market and clear the bottlenecks for the entry of medium- and long-term funds into the market”.\r\n\r\nThe announcement comes days ahead of China’s Lunar New Year holiday, a closely-watched period for retail spending and consumer sentiment.\r\n\r\nAnalysts at Bank of America estimate that the additional inflows into the equity market could be Rmb470-530bn in 2025.\r\n\r\n“Clearly regulators do care about the stock market. They want to adopt a supportive stance and keep injecting confidence into the market right before the Lunar New Year,” said Winnie Wu, chief China equity strategist at Bank of America.\r\n\r\n“Judging from today’s share price reaction, it appears that the incremental impact of pure financial and stock market related stimulus [is] no longer as powerful as it was during the last move in September 2024”, she added.\r\n\r\nChi Lo, senior Asia-Pacific market strategist at BNP Paribas Asset Management, said the announcement was a “stabilising” move because of a “lack of confidence in the private sector” and “weak demand for stocks”.\r\n\r\nThe CSI 300 index\r\n\r\nsoared in late September\r\n\r\nafter the government announced support measures, including funding for stock buybacks and mortgage cuts. But it has since fallen 15 per cent from a peak in early October.\r\n\r\nIn September, authorities also\r\n\r\nannounced a pool of $100bn\r\n\r\nto lend to companies to enact share buybacks and to lend to asset managers, insurers and brokers to buy local equities.\r\n\r\nThe index closed up 1 per cent on Thursday while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng benchmark was down 0.4 per cent.\r\n\r\nChinese insurance companies listed in Hong Kong, such as China Life Insurance and Ping An Insurance, rose 2.3 per cent and 1.9 per cent, respectively.\r\n\r\nThe latest announcement included further fee cuts to some mutual fund products and a crackdown on speculative trading of Chinese shares.\r\n\r\nRecommended\r\n\r\nNews in-depth\r\n\r\nUS-China trade dispute\r\n\r\nChina sees room to avert trade war with Donald Trump despite tariff threat\r\n\r\nIt also included measures to give state-owned insurance companies incentives to focus more on long-term returns, the latest attempt from Beijing to\r\n\r\nimprove the efficiency of state-run enterprises\r\n\r\n, amid concerns over capital allocation.\r\n\r\nInvestors are watching for more signs of stimulus from Beijing this year after the September package, especially measures to support domestic consumption.\r\n\r\nAuthorities this month expanded a scheme to trade in old consumer goods, such as household appliances, for new ones.\r\n\r\n“The government has to do something to turn around confidence, and nobody knows exactly what this something is,” said Lo. “Beijing is doing different things, asking state-owned companies to buy the stock market, buy up property, and hopefully some of these things will help to turn around confidence.”\r\n\r\nCopyright\r\n\r\nThe Financial Times Limited\r\n\r\n2025\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nAll

That may not sound like much, but when you consider that the CT5-V Blackwing is\r\n\r\nlauded as one of the most expertly engineered American cars ever made\r\n\r\n,\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\nwhen you realize that the CT5-V Blackwing is likely the last of its kind, you start to see the significance of the Lyriq-V’s performance specs.\r\n\r\nPrevious\r\n\r\nNext\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n/\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nOf course, there’s some fine print to consider. That acceleration time is measured on a closed course, using the Lyriq-V’s Velocity Max that’s also available on Cadillac’s forthcoming EV lineup that includes the\r\n\r\nVistiq\r\n\r\n,\r\n\r\nOptiq\r\n\r\n, and\r\n\r\nEscalade IQ\r\n\r\n. And it includes a metric called “Initial Vehicle Movement,” which is when the vehicle starts moving rather than when the green light goes off.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, there are plenty of EVs that can accelerate to 60mph in under three seconds. But I don’t think Cadillac was out to shatter any records with the Lyriq-V. It wanted to make a car that “fits perfectly” into people’s lives, as Cadillac boss John Roth says.\r\n\r\nTo that end, the Lyriq-V looks like it takes a lot of what worked with\r\n\r\nthe original Lyriq\r\n\r\nand made it more powerful.

Cadillac would be the latest to add its own spin on plug-in power.\r\n\r\nStarting at $79,990 (including destination charges), the 2026 Lyriq-V is expected to start production at GM’s Spring Hill, Tennessee, factory in early 2025.\r\n\r\nSee More\r\n\r\n:\r\n\r\nCars\r\n\r\nElectric Cars\r\n\r\nGM\r\n\r\nNews\r\n\r\nTech\r\n\r\nTranspo\r\n\r\nMost Popular\r\n\r\nMost Popular\r\n\r\nGoogle Fi is launching a $35 / month unlimited plan\r\n\r\nBethesda officially reveals Oblivion Remastered, available today\r\n\r\nOpenAI tells judge it would buy Chrome from Google\r\n\r\nTesla’s revenue and profits tank amid political chaos\r\n\r\nT-Mobile is shuffling its high-end plans\r\n\r\nInstaller\r\n\r\nA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.\r\n\r\nEmail (required)\r\n\r\nSign Up\r\n\r\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our\r\n\r\nTerms\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\nPrivacy Notice\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google\r\n\r\nPrivacy Policy\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\nTerms of Service\r\n\r\napply.\r\n\r\nAdvertiser Content From\r\n\r\nThis is the title for the native ad\r\n\r\nMore in\r\n\r\nNews\r\n\r\nRoku announces its smallest streaming sticks yet\r\n\r\nNvidia’s AI assistant on Windows now has plugins for Spotify, Twitch, and more\r\n\r\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot redesigned with new search, image, and notebook features\r\n\r\nCadillac teases a V-badged Optiq SUV\r\n\r\nGhost of Yōtei hits the PS5 in October\r\n\r\nElon Musk says he’ll step back from DOGE starting in May\r\n\r\nRoku announces its smallest streaming sticks yet\r\n\r\nChris Welch\r\n\r\nTwo hours ago\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\nComment Icon Bubble\r\n\r\nNvidia’s AI assistant on Windows now has plugins for Spotify, Twitch, and more\r\n\r\nTom Warren\r\n\r\nTwo hours ago\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\nComment Icon Bubble\r\n\r\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot redesigned with new search, image, and notebook features\r\n\r\nTom Warren\r\n\r\nTwo hours ago\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\nComment Icon Bubble\r\n\r\nCadillac teases a V-badged Optiq SUV\r\n\r\nAndrew J.

The company <a\r\n            href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/31/deepminds-latest-alphafold-model-is-more-useful-for-drug-discovery/\">teased\r\n            the release late last year</a> but this marks its official debut.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I’ll let the science blogs get into exactly how the new model improves outcomes, but\r\n        suffice it here to say that a variety of improvements and modeling techniques have made AlphaFold 3 not just\r\n        more accurate, but more widely applicable.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the limitations of protein modeling is that even if you know the shape a\r\n        sequence of amino acids will take, that doesn’t mean you necessarily know what other molecules it will bind to,\r\n        and how. And if you want to actually do things with these molecules, which most do, you needed to find that out\r\n        through more laborious modeling and testing.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Biology is a dynamic system, and you have to understand how properties of biology\r\n        emerged through the <em>interactions</em> between different molecules in the cell. And you can think of\r\n        AlphaFold 3 as our first big step towards that,” Hassabis said. “It’s able to model proteins interacting, of\r\n        course, with other proteins, but also other biomolecules, including, importantly DNA and RNA strands.”</p>\r\n    <br>\r\n\r\n    <p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AlphaFold 3 allows multiple molecules to be simulated at once — for example, a strand\r\n        of DNA, some DNA-binding molecules and perhaps some ions to spice things up. Here’s what you get for one such\r\n        specific combination, with the DNA ribbons going up the middle, the proteins glomming onto the side, and I think\r\n        those are the ions nestled in the middle there like little eggs:</p>\r\n\r\n    <figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"650\"\r\n            src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/alphafold-server_35e120.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\"\r\n            class=\"wp-image-2766007\">\r\n    </figure>\r\n\r\n    <p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This, of course, isn’t a scientific discovery in and of itself. But even to figure out\r\n        that an experimental protein would bind at all, or in this way, or contort to this shape, was generally the work\r\n        of days at the least or perhaps weeks to months.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While it’s difficult to overstate the excitement in this field over the last few\r\n        years, researchers have largely been hamstrung by the lack of interaction modeling (of which the new version\r\n        offers a form) and difficulty deploying the model.</p>\r\n\r\n    <br>\r\n\r\n\r\n    <p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This second issue is perhaps the greater of the two, as while the new modeling\r\n        techniques were “open” in some sense, like other AI models they are not necessarily simple to deploy and\r\n        operate. That’s why Google DeepMind is offering AlphaFold Server, a free, fully hosted web application making\r\n        the model available for non-commercial use.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s free and quite easy to use — I did it in another window on the call while they\r\n        were explaining it (which is how I got the image above). You just need a Google account, and then you feed it as\r\n        many sequences and categories as it can handle — there are some examples provided — and submit; in a few minutes\r\n        your job should be done and you’ll be given a live 3D molecule colored to represent the model’s confidence in\r\n        the conformation at that position. As you can see in the one above, the tips of the ribbons and those parts more\r\n        exposed to rogue atoms are lighter or red to indicate less confidence.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I asked whether there was any real difference between the publicly available model and\r\n        the one being used internally; Hassabis said that “We’ve made the majority of the new model’s capabilities\r\n        available,” but didn’t elaborate beyond that.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s clearly Google throwing its weight about — while to a certain extent, keeping the\r\n        best bits for themselves, which of course is their prerogative.

With Xtend’s platform, operators can directly control drones and\r\n        robots — optionally with a VR headset — or train AI models to be deployed on drones that identify objects and\r\n        help navigate indoor/outdoor environments. Today, the company announced a $40 million funding round led by\r\n        Chartered Group at a post-money valuation around $110 million.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our platform empowers drones and robots to handle specific tasks autonomously, like\r\n        entering buildings and scanning floors,” Aviv said. “Crucially, it allows the ‘common sense’ decisions — like\r\n        judging situations or adapting to unforeseen circumstances — to remain in the hands of human supervisors.”</p>\r\n\r\n    <p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Xtend allows operators to orchestrate teams of drones and robots — not just individual\r\n        machines — and have them perform certain tasks autonomously, like moving from waypoint to waypoint. All the\r\n        while, Xtend analyzes data from past deployments to recommend actions that an operator might take.</p>\r\n    <br>\r\n\r\n    <figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full wp-image-2699771\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\r\n            width=\"2136\" height=\"1205\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/wolverine.png\" alt=\"Xtend\"\r\n            class=\"wp-image-2699771\"\r\n            srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/wolverine.png 2136w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/wolverine.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/wolverine.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/wolverine.png?resize=768,433 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/wolverine.png?resize=680,384 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/wolverine.png?resize=1200,677 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/wolverine.png?resize=1280,722 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/wolverine.png?resize=430,243 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/wolverine.png?resize=720,406 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/wolverine.png?resize=900,508 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/wolverine.png?resize=800,451 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/wolverine.png?resize=1536,867 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/wolverine.png?resize=2048,1155 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/wolverine.png?resize=668,377 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/wolverine.png?resize=665,375 665w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/wolverine.png?resize=1094,617 1094w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/wolverine.png?resize=708,399 708w\"\r\n            sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2136px) 100vw, 2136px\">\r\n        \r\n    </figure>\r\n\r\n    <p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Xos empowers a single supervisor to oversee a team of robots performing tasks at\r\n        various locations simultaneously,” Aviv said. “We believe complete autonomy isn’t the ultimate goal, but rather\r\n        a subset of capabilities.”</p>\r\n\r\n    <p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Xtend pitches its technology as general-purpose, aimed at customers in industries\r\n        ranging from public safety to logistics.

Our vision was to develop technology that would make controlling these robots intuitive and accessible, like how users interact with smartphones without needing in-depth technical knowledge.”\r\n\r\nXtend provides a platform that lets operators manage drones and robots developed both in-house by Xtend and third-party vendors. With Xtend’s platform, operators can directly control drones and robots — optionally with a VR headset — or train AI models to be deployed on drones that identify objects and help navigate indoor/outdoor environments. Today, the company announced a $40 million funding round led by Chartered Group at a post-money valuation around $110 million.\r\n\r\n“Our platform empowers drones and robots to handle specific tasks autonomously, like entering buildings and scanning floors,” Aviv said. “Crucially, it allows the ‘common sense’ decisions — like judging situations or adapting to unforeseen circumstances — to remain in the hands of human supervisors.”\r\n\r\nXtend allows operators to orchestrate teams of drones and robots — not just individual machines — and have them perform certain tasks autonomously, like moving from waypoint to waypoint. All the while, Xtend analyzes data from past deployments to recommend actions that an operator might take.\r\n\r\nXtend’s Wolverine drone. Image Credits:Xtend\r\n\r\n“Xos empowers a single supervisor to oversee a team of robots performing tasks at various locations simultaneously,” Aviv said. “We believe complete autonomy isn’t the ultimate goal, but rather a subset of capabilities.”\r\n\r\nXtend pitches its technology as general-purpose, aimed at customers in industries ranging from public safety to logistics. But the company leans heavily into military, defense and law enforcement applications.\r\n\r\nXtend has contracts with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the U.S. Department of Defense to “develop and deliver its systems,” including drone interceptor systems, for “operational evaluation” — including a $9 million deal with the Pentagon’s irregular warfare office. And Aviv isn’t shy about the company’s ambitions to move into what he calls “new civil market opportunities,” like private and public security.\r\n\r\n“Imagine a police officer coordinating drones to search a large area for a suspect,” Aviv said. “Xos can empowers these professionals to leverage robotic assistance.”\r\n\r\nThis could be problematic, given that that regulations are still largely lacking for law enforcement usage, and drones have been used to surveil legal demonstrations — for instance, in 2020, Congressional Democrats raised alarm that drones and spy planes had been used by the administration of then-President Donald Trump to watch demonstrations in Las Vegas, Minneapolis and Washington, D.C., according to Al Jazeera.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Xtend has recently found itself in the crosshairs of international monitors.\r\n\r\nStatewatch and Informationsstelle Militarisierung (IMI) found in an analysis that Xtend, among other Israeli military companies and institutions involved in drone deployment, received an R&D grant from the EU’s Horizon Europe fund despite a prohibition on EU funding for military and defense projects.\r\n\r\nAviv has taken a strongly pro-Israel stance in the country’s ongoing war with Hamas, telling Ctech that Xtend has “redirected energies to supporting the IDF 100%.” On its website, which features testimonials from Israeli troops in Gaza, Xtend says that it enables “soldiers to perform accurate manoeuvres in complex combat scenarios.”\r\n\r\nIn an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Aviv said that Xtend has been working with the IDF for some time — initially to take down incendiary balloons originating from the Gaza Strip. Since then, its drones have being used to map and scout out subterranean tunnels dug by Hamas in Gaza — and, far more alarmingly, sent on reconnaissance missions equipped with explosive payloads like grenades.\r\n\r\nControversial as it may be, the strategy appears to be working for Xtend’s business. The company says it’s won $50 million in contracts to date across its customer base of “over 50” organizations, including government defense agencies.\r\n\r\n“We’re unlocking the true potential of robotics in complex scenarios, including first response, search and rescue and critical infrastructure inspection,” Aviv said. “Hundreds of Xtend’s drone and robotics systems are already operationally deployed worldwide, and we are continuously developing Xos and those platforms to deliver the future of human-machine teaming.\r\n\r\nWith the new funding, which brings Xtend’s total raised to $65 million, Xtend plans to grow its 110-person workforce by 50% across the U.S., Israel and Singapore by the end of the year as it shifts to a combination of platform-as-a-service and software-as-a-service sales model.

In the\r\n            first case, the court found that Google <a\r\n                href=\"/2024/8/5/24155520/judge-rules-on-us-doj-v-google-antitrust-search-suit\">illegally maintained its\r\n                monopoly over web search</a> with a series of default placement deals, most particularly on the iPhone.\r\n            That case is <a href=\"/policy/652708/google-search-antitrust-remedies-trial-opening\">back in court right\r\n                now</a> for the second phase of the trial, where a judge will decide what the remedy will be —\r\n            essentially, how Google will be punished.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            The government is asking for a very big remedy: it wants Google to <a\r\n                href=\"/news/653882/openai-chrome-google-us-judge\">sell off its Chrome browser</a> and make its search\r\n            data more accessible to rivals. On top of that, literally simultaneously, Google just <a\r\n                href=\"/news/650665/google-loses-ad-tech-antitrust-monopoly-lawsuit\">lost another antitrust case</a>. A\r\n            different court ruled last week that the company “substantially harmed publishers and users on the web with\r\n            its advertising monopoly.”</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            That case will also now head to a remedies phase, and it’s very likely the government will ask for part of\r\n            Google’s ad tech system to be sold off as well. Obviously, Google says it’s going to appeal all of this, so\r\n            it will all take many more years to play out. But these initial verdicts are clear, and chances are high\r\n            that Google and the web itself will be very different when everything comes to a close.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n   \r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            Now, the search case was filed during the first Trump administration, but Jonathan and his team took it to\r\n            trial and won. Jonathan and his team also filed the Google ad tech case in 2023. That same team also filed a\r\n            big antitrust case against Apple. And if you’ve listened to Jonathan’s appearances on the show, you know\r\n            that he had to play the role of buttoned-up prosecutor while he was working for the DOJ. But now that he’s\r\n            out, he’s much more free to share his real thoughts on what it takes to build and win these cases and about\r\n            what should happen next.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            You will not be surprised to hear that Jonathan thinks we should break up Google, but I think you’ll find it\r\n            fascinating to hear how we put together his team, how he thought through the construction of these two cases\r\n            in particular, and what kinds of audiences he thought he was addressing in the legal complaints themselves.\r\n        </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            Jonathan thinks of it as being head of a very specialized boutique law firm within the government, staffed\r\n            by the most talented trial and antitrust attorneys the industry had to offer. That’s <em>Decoder</em> bait\r\n            all by itself, but the weirdest part is that Jonathan left and had to hand that entire law firm and those\r\n            cases over to an entirely new administration.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    \r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            So I wanted to ask him about what happens now that Donald Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi are in charge\r\n            of his little law firm, especially because we’re seeing a pretty intense political realignment around\r\n            antitrust these past few years. There are some prominent members of the new administration and the MAGA\r\n            movement who have reached a rare consensus with some Democrats around breaking up big tech.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            So I wanted to know if the DOJ’s Antitrust Division was still able to operate at the same level of\r\n            effectiveness now, or if DOGE and the Trump administration’s purge of non-loyalists has hollowed it out. I\r\n            also really wanted to know what Jonathan thought of the case his counterparts at the Federal Trade\r\n            Commission are <a href=\"/policy/649520/zuckerberg-meta-ftc-antitrust-testimony-facebook-history\">pursuing\r\n                against Meta in court right now</a>. That case seems much messier, but still might result in the breakup\r\n            of Instagram and WhatsApp.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            As you’ll hear, Jonathan was quite cordial about his replacement, Gail Slater. He was also optimistic about\r\n            Attorney General Pam Bondi and Federal Trade Commission Chair Andrew Ferguson, who he hopes will continue to\r\n            aggressively pursue tech regulation instead of treating the government like it’s “coin-operated,” which is\r\n            something that <a href=\"/2025/1/20/24346317/trump-gangster-tech-regulation-corruption-grift\">many big tech\r\n                executives would like it to be</a>. In general, I’m deeply worried about the perception of corruption\r\n            and the amount of nihilism that so many people feel towards the rule of law right now.

That case focused on Google’s core product, which is a\r\n            search monopoly.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            This case focuses on all the interactions a lot of people have with Google on a daily basis, but don’t\r\n            realize. So when you go out to the internet, to any site, and you see an ad, chances are very high that that\r\n            ad is passing through Google technology. Ads are bought and sold on the internet using Google’s pipes and\r\n            plumbing. So that’s what this case is about. It’s all that infrastructure, the stuff you don’t see that\r\n            allows publishers — news publishers, or anyone who creates content — to sell an ad space and anyone who\r\n            wants to buy an ad to buy ad space.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div data-concert-ads-name=\"athena_features_dynamic_mobile\"\r\n        class=\"m-ad m-ad__dynamic_ad_unit m-ad__athena_features_dynamic dfp_ad--in-body duet--mobile-athena-styles duet--ad-container--default dfp_ad-wrapper--is-empty m-ad__collapsed\">\r\n        <div id=\"div-gpt-ad-athena_features_dynamic_mobile_3\"\r\n            class=\"dynamic-js-slot dfp_ad--held-area dfp_ad--rendered dfp_ad--is-empty\"\r\n            style=\"min-width: 300px; height: 0px; width: 0px;\" data-google-query-id=\"CJmD2LCUgI0DFWbsEQgdqXEBhA\">\r\n            <div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/172968584/verge/theverge.com/podcast/decoder-podcast-with-nilay-patel_48__container__\"\r\n                style=\"border: 0pt none; width: 1030px; height: 0px;\"></div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            Now, when people think of ads, they think of <em>Mad Men</em>, right?

How they work in the modern world really is more like a commodities or a securities\r\n            exchange, or like equities, where you buy and sell programmatically on these open-market exchanges and\r\n            people bid on auctions.

So I think when you get out of\r\n            <em>Mad Men</em> and into the kind of commodities exchange mindset, the case becomes very clear. You have\r\n            the buy side and the sell side, right? The tools that someone, a publisher, will use to sell ads, the tools\r\n            that an advertiser will use to bid on and buy ads. And then you have this exchange in the middle.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            What we found in our investigation is that Google has a dominant position on the buy side, the tools that\r\n            buyers use. It has a dominant position on the tools that sellers use. It owns and has the dominant exchange\r\n            in the middle, and then Google buys and sells on its own exchange. On top of that, it then rigs the results\r\n            of those auctions, so it wins more and publishers get less money as a result.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            <strong>So those tools in the middle, that’s the open web.

The part that really interested me about this whole case is the\r\n                connection to Google Search, which is under all kinds of pressure, not just from the antitrust case that\r\n                Google now has to defend in the remedies phase, but also from AI.

Was\r\n                there ever a sense that you were chasing a thing that was dying all by itself?

First and foremost, this technology matters a lot, particularly to news publishers. News\r\n            publishers are critical for the free flow of information, which is vital to democracy, and I think that\r\n            industry has been under assault for years, in part because the revenue streams have dried up in no small\r\n            part due to Google’s conduct — in my view and in the view of the court here.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            So I think that is an important starting point. Second is, I think ahead to AI as well, and Google really,\r\n            at its heart, is an advertising company. It makes its money on advertising, and it puts out all these\r\n            products, some of which are really good and interesting, to attract users in order to get their attention,\r\n            in order to get their data, so then they can flip it to advertisers and sell it for money.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div data-concert-ads-name=\"athena_features_dynamic_mobile\"\r\n        class=\"m-ad m-ad__dynamic_ad_unit m-ad__athena_features_dynamic dfp_ad--in-body duet--mobile-athena-styles duet--ad-container--default dfp_ad-wrapper--is-empty m-ad__collapsed\">\r\n        <div id=\"div-gpt-ad-athena_features_dynamic_mobile_6\"\r\n            class=\"dynamic-js-slot dfp_ad--held-area dfp_ad--rendered dfp_ad--is-empty\"\r\n            style=\"min-width: 300px; height: 0px; width: 0px;\" data-google-query-id=\"CPnf5LGUgI0DFRGQgwcdpCYZ5g\">\r\n            <div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/172968584/verge/theverge.com/podcast/decoder-podcast-with-nilay-patel_51__container__\"\r\n                style=\"border: 0pt none; width: 1030px; height: 0px;\"></div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            When you think about where AI is going for a company like Google, that is likely to be how it monetizes a\r\n            lot of its AI business, certainly its consumer AI business. And the infrastructure that we’re talking about\r\n            here is likely to be the same kind of infrastructure, whether it’s the advertising infrastructure from the\r\n            search case or the ad tech infrastructure from the ad tech case that translates into how Google sells\r\n            advertising alongside its various consumer-based AI products. And so getting this right now wasn’t just\r\n            critical to fix these industries as they exist today, but also was to make it clear that they can’t use\r\n            these same anticompetitive practices and this playbook in the future.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            <strong>Let me push on that just a little bit harder.

Right now — the system wasn’t working, right? Companies\r\n            like Google were not only extracting all the data from these sites through crawling and indexing and\r\n            training their models, but they also were extracting massive amounts of inventory through these\r\n            intermediaries, these middlemen that they created to buy and sell and exchange ads.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            And so, we need something better, because what we have now doesn’t work.

The power of the government is extraordinarily significant, and we don’t wield it\r\n            lightly.

Some lawyers will say, “You want to write a tight, short, crisp complaint.” I actually took\r\n            a different view. My view is that we have all of this evidence. Let’s lay it all out there for the public\r\n            and the court to see at the outset. Let’s err on the side of saying more rather than less, but let’s almost\r\n            have three different stories in one.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            So the way we would structure our complaints would be a very short intro, one page or two, that gives you\r\n            the thematic opening to the case. This is the stuff that if you’re going to read one thing and you need to\r\n            quickly understand what the case is about, you can read that one or two pages and understand it. In our\r\n            case, we put it forward with that Goldman Sachs quote, because I think that really told the story.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            Then you have a longer executive summary, and this is for the person who’s got a little more time and is\r\n            willing to read 15 pages and wants to get some more detail on what are the relevant markets and what are\r\n            some of the key documents and what’s some of the harm. Then you have the antitrust nerds, like you, who want\r\n            to read the whole thing from start to finish, and that’s the additional 80, 90, or 120 pages, whatever it\r\n            might be in the case. That’s where you go really deep into the weeds and you can understand how the industry\r\n            functions, where the documents are, what Google understood it was doing at the time, why it knew that it was\r\n            behaving in an anticompetitive fashion, what the harm was, and how competitors were responding.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            Then we position all of that so that we can go to the court and say, “This is not a theory. This is not just\r\n            based on a guess. This is based on a really serious inquiry. It’s based on data. It’s based on analysis.\r\n            It’s based on internal documents and testimony, and the story is going to be coherent from start to finish.”\r\n        </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            <strong>That trend towards really readable complaints that are essentially narrative is new, right?

So we thought about how this would play\r\n            with the jury. My view is, if you can’t tell the story to a jury of your peers, how are you supposed to tell\r\n            the story to the judge, and how are you supposed to tell it to the public? So I think we didn’t want to\r\n            sacrifice sophistication, but on the other hand, having a good hook was really more about boiling something\r\n            down to its core essence. </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            It’s what lawyers do.

When I started the antitrust division, I\r\n            realized that we weren’t going to be successful unless we can convince courts, juries, and judges that we’re\r\n            right. We had the best — in my view, and still do — antitrust lawyers in the world, but many of them didn’t\r\n            have the experience of standing up in a courtroom and trying cases.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            The vision that we brought to the antitrust division when I arrived was, “How do we take world-class\r\n            antitrust lawyers and match them with world-class trial lawyers?” So we went out and built this elite core\r\n            of first-chair trial lawyers, about 25 of them. These are people who have grown up in courtrooms: former US\r\n            attorneys, assistant US attorneys, DAs, plaintiffs’ lawyers, and partners at law firms. How do we assemble\r\n            folks who really can be that lead lawyer in first, second, and third chairs alongside the antitrust experts?\r\n            And if you combine those two expertise, you can bring the sophistication and you can bring the storytelling\r\n            in court. </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            So we built that, and we brought in incredible people.

Then we assembled this incredible team of\r\n            what we called senior litigation counsel. I actually recruited a former partner of mine from private Big\r\n            Law, a woman named Julia Wood, who ended up becoming the leading trial lawyer in the case, and Aaron\r\n            Teitelbaum, who is a former prosecutor in the US Attorney’s Office, and then a number of others to help lead\r\n            the trial team and go head-to-head with my former firm Paul, Weiss.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            <strong>It sounds to me like you’re building a little law firm inside the Department of Justice.

Yeah, it’s a scrappy little law firm, certainly compared to the size of the big law firms, and\r\n            we had incredible assets when I arrived. We just needed to shape them a little bit differently. So bringing\r\n            in this trial unit, building a data scientist unit, boosting the core expertise that I thought we needed in\r\n            order to go head-to-head with companies like Google and litigate two cases in a year and win both of them,\r\n            while at the same time suing Apple, RealPage, Ticketmaster, and a number of other companies. So we needed to\r\n            scale, we needed scope, and we needed depth.

Those remedies need to be structural and forward-looking. So structural means the company has too\r\n            much power. It’s used that power, it’s abused that power, and particularly in the case of ad tech, it has\r\n            conflicts of interest. Google represents buyers and sellers on the exchange and buys and sells on its own\r\n            exchange.

The infrastructure, whether it’s\r\n            search infrastructure and search advertising infrastructure or the ad tech infrastructure, is going to be\r\n            used now going forward not only for current-day products, but also going forward as things morph into a web\r\n            that includes a lot of AI-driven content and information and products.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            So I think it needs to be structural.

But I do worry about them owning the\r\n            publisher-side tools, and then we’d worry about them recreating a lot of the same advertising and exchange\r\n            tools and then creating that functionality somewhere else in the marketplace, like in a browser, for\r\n            example.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            So you need to have really good fencing-in remedies, as we call them in the industry, and other kinds of\r\n            anti-circumvention provisions. I also do think that when you look across both cases, it’s quite clear that\r\n            their strength flows from the small and medium-sized businesses that advertise on AdWords. That’s their core\r\n            fire hose of demand, and that has been built now through two markets where they’ve been found to have\r\n            violated the antitrust laws. So I think you need to take a very careful look at AdWords.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            I think an independent AdWords would be extraordinarily powerful and would address all of those conflicts of\r\n            interest quite quickly. Now, ultimately, it’ll be up to the folks who are in the DOJ today and the state\r\n            attorneys general to make that determination, just to be very clear. It’s out of my hands. I no longer have\r\n            a say in the matter, but I think there’s a lot of value to be created.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            I think also — and Wall Street is now confronting this across a lot of different industries — that these\r\n            conglomerates, by accumulating, acquiring all these assets, have actually destroyed a lot of value. You’d\r\n            actually have more value created overnight, frankly, if you start divesting assets. You can look at what\r\n            General Electric did, for example — voluntarily, not for antitrust reasons, but for business reasons.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            You look at a company like Google, and just to be very clear, this asset wasn’t part of the case, but if\r\n            Google divested YouTube, the <a\r\n                href=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/articles/magnificent-7-stocks-explainer\">Mag Seven</a> would\r\n            become the Mag Eight overnight, and you’d probably unlock a lot of shareholder or market value. There are\r\n            two separate discussions. One is what needs to be done for the purposes of resolving the antitrust case, and\r\n            I think there are structural remedies in terms of breakup that should be and will be on the table.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            Then there’s the second question, which is just from an efficiency and market perspective: are these\r\n            companies too big?

The fact of the matter is, Google is going to continue to exist after this case, and it’s going to\r\n            continue to be a really significant company, just as AT&amp;T continued after its breakup.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            <strong>But AT&amp;T reformed itself, like the Terminator. </strong></p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            Well, it kind of did, that’s true. But I will also say, quite interestingly, it was the Reagan\r\n            administration that ultimately pulled the trigger on breaking up AT&amp;T. There were <a\r\n                href=\"https://www.fjc.gov/history/spotlight-judicial-history/breakup-ma-bell\">multiple cases going back\r\n                to the ‘50s</a> that involved patent divestitures, licenses, and other things. But ultimately, it was\r\n            the Western Electric case, and that separated the hardware from the line, right?</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            It used to be that you had to rent a rotary phone from AT&amp;T with their proprietary plug and plug it into\r\n            the wall. The DOJ got AT&amp;T to sell off Western Electric to break the hardware up from the line. And\r\n            guess what? We saw tons of innovation. Companies first started building the phones with buttons rather than\r\n            rotors, and then you saw cordless phones, and eventually you saw wireless and smartphones. So I think it was\r\n            great for innovation.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            There’s an argument that if the government hadn’t broken up AT&amp;T, we all might be walking around with\r\n            iPhones that have big rotors on them that had to be plugged into your wall. So a lot of antitrust over the\r\n            years has actually unlocked a lot of innovation. Now, throughout the ‘80s and beyond, a lot of those\r\n            antitrust breakups, whether it was in oil or in telecommunications or other areas, resulted in the companies\r\n            reforming themselves in a very Borg-like way. The company re-assimilated its old components and created\r\n            AT&amp;T. So I think there are good questions about whether we should let them reformulate, but I think it\r\n            is indisputable, at least in my view, that these breakups have actually generated rather than destroyed\r\n            value.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            <strong>The iPhone is an interesting one, because it launched with a singular executive on stage, and then\r\n                by the time it actually came out, it was AT&amp;T once again. So you just see that the industry kind of\r\n                re-rolled itself up into different kinds of companies, maybe with the same name. But what’s\r\n                fundamentally interesting to me is Microsoft. The Microsoft antitrust case is in a way what allowed\r\n                Google to exist, right? It allowed the open web to thrive. Do you see a challenger like that to Google\r\n                that hasn’t been able to exist because Google is dominant in the places where it’s dominant?</strong>\r\n        </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            Absolutely. So to me, antitrust is most important when you reach inflection points in the market. So the\r\n            AT&amp;T case preceded the emergence of the PC. There’s an IBM antitrust case that preceded the emergence of\r\n            software and operating systems. The Microsoft case immediately preceded the internet era and the launch of\r\n            Google. </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            I think what enforcers and the antitrust lawyers are concerned about is that incumbents, seeing these new\r\n            threats and these new inflection points coming, will use their power to slow them down and make sure that\r\n            they can transfer their dominance from market A to market B. They can incumbent-advantage into this new\r\n            technology. But that’s not what you want. What you want as an enforcer is you want these new, nimble\r\n            companies to emerge without the kind of lethargy of a big monopoly aircraft carrier, and you want someone\r\n            who can move quickly and decisively.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            So if Microsoft had won its antitrust case, who knows what would have happened? Perhaps it could have owned\r\n            the browser market. Perhaps it could have owned the search market. It could have owned all these businesses.\r\n            But instead, companies like Google and others were allowed to thrive. It’s not lost on us when we put this\r\n            in our Apple case that iTunes and the iPod, which was really the precursor to the iPhone, really got\r\n            traction when it went from being a Mac-only product to a Windows product, too.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            When you can use your iPod at the time with your Windows computer, because iTunes was available, that was\r\n            something that was made possible by the Microsoft consent decree that involved competing media players being\r\n            on Windows. So all of these things interact with one another. We’re sitting here now on the dawn of this new\r\n            era. You had Web 1.0 and 2.0, and now we’re moving to the AI-based web, where you interact with agents and\r\n            all other cool stuff that you all at <em>The Verge</em> talk about all the time. We want to make sure that\r\n            those new companies, those little tech companies, those startups, those other incumbents in other areas who\r\n            see as an opportunity to diversify can come in here and invent new technologies and compete on the merits\r\n            rather than running into obstacles. </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            If you look at both Google cases, the obstacles were manmade, kind of like our economic problems today.\r\n            They’re not due to better innovation. They’re due to contractual restrictions. It’s Google <a\r\n                href=\"/2024/5/2/24147007/google-paid-apple-20-billion-in-2022-to-be-safaris-default-search-engine\">paying\r\n                Apple $20 billion</a> to lock up search defaults, it’s Google tying products and services together or\r\n            giving itself first look or last look on auctions, which is what we proved in the ad tech case, rather than\r\n            having an open auction where anybody can win. It’s putting sand in the gears or bumps on the road to slow\r\n            other people down rather than speeding themselves up to innovate in order to compete.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            <strong>Sure, I buy that argument with Microsoft, maybe because I was young and Microsoft was the evil\r\n                empire during that time.

But I think part of what we’re trying to do is we’re trying to go giant by giant\r\n            and make sure that they can’t use their power in one market to dominate another. So if you look at where the\r\n            antitrust cases are, let’s look at the Big Four right now across the two agencies. It’s Google, Amazon,\r\n            Apple, and Meta. The idea is saying, “Okay, we’ve had these massive conglomerates who are locking up\r\n            commerce and locking up business and innovation who have become these sort of essential platforms, and\r\n            they’re making it hard for new folks to emerge.”</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            Whether you root for OpenAI or against OpenAI is a separate question. You can’t say that there should be no\r\n            more innovation or no more progress. We just want to make sure that the markets are as competitive as\r\n            possible. That’s a separate question, in my view, from whether we need other kinds of restrictions, like on\r\n            privacy or data use or copyright. I think there are a lot of important conversations to be had.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            But once a company has so much power, it’s hard to have market-based solutions to any of those problems if\r\n            you don’t have competition. So you got to start by saying, “Let’s make the market as competitive as\r\n            possible, figure out how a competitive market and all the innovations that flow from that can result in\r\n            advances and help maybe get people innovate on better copyright solutions or better privacy solutions.”</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            Then if there are market failures or safety, privacy, and security issues that aren’t being addressed by the\r\n            market, then you can put some lines on the road so people can drive in the right lanes. But I think none of\r\n            that works unless you have a free, fair, and competitive marketplace.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            <strong>Both of these cases went to trial during the Biden administration, but the DOJ under Donald Trump\r\n                looks very different.

I think\r\n            what I saw was very different from what a lot of people portray about government workers. These are people\r\n            who are working harder than folks in the private sector for less money and, frankly, are under-resourced,\r\n            significantly so.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            The value that we created for the economy was extraordinary, and I will say we did it at the antitrust\r\n            division at zero cost to taxpayers, and I ran a unit with a budget surplus every year. We ran solely on <a\r\n                href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/competition-matters/2025/02/new-hsr-thresholds-filing-fees-2025\">Hart-Scott-Rodino\r\n                fees</a>.

I don’t know that that was being\r\n            driven by the antitrust division, but I think those are more of the DOGE-style efforts where people who\r\n            don’t really understand how things work come in, feel like they need to break something in order to prove\r\n            that they’re doing their jobs, and then end up causing more harm than good.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            <strong>You ran a pretty independent operation from Merrick Garland, the attorney general under Biden.

Pam\r\n                Bondi is firing attorneys and trying to wrestle control of various divisions.

So I think creating centers of excellence inside\r\n            the Department of Justice, giving prosecutors and lawyers the ability to investigate and bring cases that\r\n            are right on the law and right on the facts, is the right way to do it.

I don’t view that as a problem. I view that as a rarity, and an\r\n            unfortunate rarity in today’s society, where you actually can have agreement on things among people who sit\r\n            on both sides of the aisle.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            At the same time, I had Republicans and Democrats who were unhappy with what we were doing, and it just\r\n            didn’t neatly break down along neat political lines, and that’s fine. I think if that’s the case for\r\n            antitrust, that’s a good thing, and we shouldn’t shy away from that. Of course, there’ll be differences and\r\n            people might do different things or have different motivations for what they’re doing, but so long as\r\n            they’re done for legitimate policy and law enforcement reasons, I think I’m pleased that we have actual\r\n            continuity.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            I think it’s something we should celebrate rather than reject, but I also understand at the same time why\r\n            there’s a degree of distrust and concern. Again, when you see these modern-day oligarchs in the rotunda\r\n            giving money and trying to buy their way out of antitrust cases, it raises concerns. We should not have a\r\n            government that’s coin-operated that way, and hopefully we won’t.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            <strong>Coin-operated is a good phrase.

And instead of competing by\r\n            building their own stuff, which [Meta was] trying to do and not doing as good a job, the FTC is saying they\r\n            just went and bought them, and said so in their documents that, “We’re buying them because they’re a\r\n            competitive threat, and we’re going to neutralize that competitive threat so that we can maintain our\r\n            power.” I think if the court focuses on the words of the executives, they have a very strong case.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"duet--article--article-body-component\">\r\n        <p\r\n            class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1\">\r\n            <strong>I think I look at it and I say, “Well, Facebook today is not just about friends and family.

That case is back in court right now for the second phase of the trial, where a judge will decide what the remedy will be — essentially, how Google will be punished.\r\n\r\nThe government is asking for a very big remedy: it wants Google to sell off its Chrome browser and make its search data more accessible to rivals. On top of that, literally simultaneously, Google just lost another antitrust case. A different court ruled last week that the company “substantially harmed publishers and users on the web with its advertising monopoly.”\r\n\r\nThat case will also now head to a remedies phase, and it’s very likely the government will ask for part of Google’s ad tech system to be sold off as well. Obviously, Google says it’s going to appeal all of this, so it will all take many more years to play out. But these initial verdicts are clear, and chances are high that Google and the web itself will be very different when everything comes to a close.\r\n\r\nNow, the search case was filed during the first Trump administration, but Jonathan and his team took it to trial and won. Jonathan and his team also filed the Google ad tech case in 2023. That same team also filed a big antitrust case against Apple. And if you’ve listened to Jonathan’s appearances on the show, you know that he had to play the role of buttoned-up prosecutor while he was working for the DOJ. But now that he’s out, he’s much more free to share his real thoughts on what it takes to build and win these cases and about what should happen next.\r\n\r\nYou will not be surprised to hear that Jonathan thinks we should break up Google, but I think you’ll find it fascinating to hear how we put together his team, how he thought through the construction of these two cases in particular, and what kinds of audiences he thought he was addressing in the legal complaints themselves.\r\n\r\nListen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here!\r\n\r\nJonathan thinks of it as being head of a very specialized boutique law firm within the government, staffed by the most talented trial and antitrust attorneys the industry had to offer. That’s Decoder bait all by itself, but the weirdest part is that Jonathan left and had to hand that entire law firm and those cases over to an entirely new administration.\r\n\r\nSo I wanted to ask him about what happens now that Donald Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi are in charge of his little law firm, especially because we’re seeing a pretty intense political realignment around antitrust these past few years. There are some prominent members of the new administration and the MAGA movement who have reached a rare consensus with some Democrats around breaking up big tech.\r\n\r\nSo I wanted to know if the DOJ’s Antitrust Division was still able to operate at the same level of effectiveness now, or if DOGE and the Trump administration’s purge of non-loyalists has hollowed it out. I also really wanted to know what Jonathan thought of the case his counterparts at the Federal Trade Commission are pursuing against Meta in court right now. That case seems much messier, but still might result in the breakup of Instagram and WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nAs you’ll hear, Jonathan was quite cordial about his replacement, Gail Slater. He was also optimistic about Attorney General Pam Bondi and Federal Trade Commission Chair Andrew Ferguson, who he hopes will continue to aggressively pursue tech regulation instead of treating the government like it’s “coin-operated,” which is something that many big tech executives would like it to be. In general, I’m deeply worried about the perception of corruption and the amount of nihilism that so many people feel towards the rule of law right now. So we talked about that a little bit as well.\r\n\r\nYou’ll hear me say this again a little bit, but we’ve had a lot of full-circle moments on Decoder this year, and getting Jonathan to come back on the show after he’s left office might be my favorite one yet.\r\n\r\nOkay, Jonathan Kanter, the former assistant attorney general for antitrust at the US Department of Justice. Here we go.\r\n\r\nThis interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\r\n\r\nJonathan Kanter, you’re the former assistant attorney general for antitrust at the United States Department of Justice. Welcome back to Decoder.\r\n\r\nGreat to be back, and yes, free and clear.\r\n\r\nYou’re one of our few third-time guests, and I’m particularly excited because you’re not in the Department of Justice anymore. You’re free. You could just say whatever you want.\r\n\r\nIt’s a weird feeling to just say what’s on your mind. I love it.\r\n\r\nI’m very excited. We’ve done a lot of full-circle Decoder episodes this year, but this one in particular I am excited for. The last time you were on, you had just won an antitrust case against Google in search. You’re on the show again today. The Department of Justice, not your Department of Justice anymore, but your case at the Department of Justice has been won. Google has lost the antitrust case in the ad tech market, which is very different from the search market, although I did find it interesting the judge made reference to the search case as well. So let’s just start at the beginning: What is this case? Why is it different from the search case?\r\n\r\nThe search case is the Google that most consumers know, which is you go to Google.com or to your search bar, you put in a search, and you get an answer back. That case focused on Google’s core product, which is a search monopoly.\r\n\r\nThis case focuses on all the interactions a lot of people have with Google on a daily basis, but don’t realize. So when you go out to the internet, to any site, and you see an ad, chances are very high that that ad is passing through Google technology. Ads are bought and sold on the internet using Google’s pipes and plumbing. So that’s what this case is about. It’s all that infrastructure, the stuff you don’t see that allows publishers — news publishers, or anyone who creates content — to sell an ad space and anyone who wants to buy an ad to buy ad space.\r\n\r\nNow, when people think of ads, they think of Mad Men, right? They think of the old-style “pouring a glass of whiskey and taking someone out to buy some airtime” kind of ads. That’s really not how ads work in the modern world. How they work in the modern world really is more like a commodities or a securities exchange, or like equities, where you buy and sell programmatically on these open-market exchanges and people bid on auctions. That’s how ads are sold, and this case is about exactly that technology.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of complicated components to that digital auction. The way that I always think about it is there’s a lot of different software products that interact at every stage of that, and in most of those markets where those products play, Google is the one or two player. It just has a dominant position across every piece of technology you need to make an ad auction go.\r\n\r\nExactly.\r\n\r\nHow did you put this case together? How did you see that this was a problem, where did it come from, and how did you know, “Okay, this is one we can go win”?\r\n\r\nThis is years in the making, but the facts here are incredibly strong. So I think when you get out of Mad Men and into the kind of commodities exchange mindset, the case becomes very clear. You have the buy side and the sell side, right? The tools that someone, a publisher, will use to sell ads, the tools that an advertiser will use to bid on and buy ads. And then you have this exchange in the middle.\r\n\r\nWhat we found in our investigation is that Google has a dominant position on the buy side, the tools that buyers use. It has a dominant position on the tools that sellers use. It owns and has the dominant exchange in the middle, and then Google buys and sells on its own exchange. On top of that, it then rigs the results of those auctions, so it wins more and publishers get less money as a result.\r\n\r\nSo those tools in the middle, that’s the open web. What you’re describing here is the open web, right?\r\n\r\nExactly.\r\n\r\nYou run a website. You put some ad slots on it. You buy some software products to auction off that inventory. Someone shows up to use some other tools to buy it. That’s a smaller piece of Google’s revenue today than it was before. The part that really interested me about this whole case is the connection to Google Search, which is under all kinds of pressure, not just from the antitrust case that Google now has to defend in the remedies phase, but also from AI. Everyone can see what SEO is doing to the web overall, too.\r\n\r\nSo you can see the web is under all this pressure. It’s under revenue pressure from Google as well because of all of the antitrust activity, because of all the monopolization in the ad tech space you’re describing, but then Google itself is making more money on its own platforms, on Search itself, on YouTube. Was there ever a sense that you were chasing a thing that was dying all by itself? Because that felt to me like the hardest part of the puzzle here.\r\n\r\nNot at all. First and foremost, this technology matters a lot, particularly to news publishers. News publishers are critical for the free flow of information, which is vital to democracy, and I think that industry has been under assault for years, in part because the revenue streams have dried up in no small part due to Google’s conduct — in my view and in the view of the court here.\r\n\r\nSo I think that is an important starting point. Second is, I think ahead to AI as well, and Google really, at its heart, is an advertising company. It makes its money on advertising, and it puts out all these products, some of which are really good and interesting, to attract users in order to get their attention, in order to get their data, so then they can flip it to advertisers and sell it for money.\r\n\r\nWhen you think about where AI is going for a company like Google, that is likely to be how it monetizes a lot of its AI business, certainly its consumer AI business. And the infrastructure that we’re talking about here is likely to be the same kind of infrastructure, whether it’s the advertising infrastructure from the search case or the ad tech infrastructure from the ad tech case that translates into how Google sells advertising alongside its various consumer-based AI products. And so getting this right now wasn’t just critical to fix these industries as they exist today, but also was to make it clear that they can’t use these same anticompetitive practices and this playbook in the future.\r\n\r\nLet me push on that just a little bit harder. I hear that. The nihilist in me says, “Well, it’s already too late. The web has been scraped by all of the model makers fully and completely. The economics of starting a new website are pretty bad. Most new information happens on a closed platform.”\r\n\r\nWill a case like this, combined with the search case, result in the economics of publishing on the web being better than they are today?\r\n\r\nHopefully they will result in new businesses being funded and entering the market to figure out how to monetize content, how to monetize AI, how to sell advertising to advertisers, and how to help publishers figure out better ways to maximize their revenue. Right now — the system wasn’t working, right? Companies like Google were not only extracting all the data from these sites through crawling and indexing and training their models, but they also were extracting massive amounts of inventory through these intermediaries, these middlemen that they created to buy and sell and exchange ads.\r\n\r\nAnd so, we need something better, because what we have now doesn’t work. And so, either we can roll over and say, “Well, we’ll just throw our hands up. The market’s moved on to something else that they’re going to dominate and use the same playbook,” or we can fight. We could say what they did was wrong. They broke the law, and they shouldn’t do it again in the future.\r\n\r\nOne of the things that really struck me about the search case was Google’s pretty compelling argument that, “Yeah. The market might be distorted in favor of Google Search, but everything else is bad. Bing is just bad. There are other competitors that mostly use the Bing index. It’s just bad.” Satya Nadella took the stand and basically said, “I can make Bing better, but it wouldn’t be worth it.”\r\n\r\nAnd the real competition, as you and I discussed, was maybe from these AI products. It might disrupt search in some other way. And then the real problem was, by paying Apple for default placement, no one else could ever get the volume of search clicks to be better. But at the end of the day, Google’s core argument was, “Look, our product is just better. People like it. If we didn’t pay Apple, people would just choose Google by default. We might as well get some money.”\r\n\r\nThey lost on that argument, but the way they fought back was very intuitive. It was intuitive to say, “Look, our product is better. It’s winning in the marketplace. This distortion, just ignore it.” Again, they lost that case, but I understood the argument.\r\n\r\nThey made the same kind of argument in the ad tech case. Did you find it as compelling? Did you find it as distracting? Did you find it to be as much of a reflection of, “Well, the product is superior, so the product stays superior,” as I thought in search?\r\n\r\nI found it flat. If you listened to the trial and followed the trial, what you heard is publisher after publisher coming in saying they hated it, that they wanted to work with somebody else, that the technology sucked, that Google was giving themselves an advantage over others, that they wanted the freedom to work with other competitors, but that Google was imposing restrictions, whether they were tying restrictions or providing limited access to inventory for other publishing ad servers, the whole range of conduct that actually made it harder to work with rivals and pissed off, to a significant degree, most everyone in the industry.\r\n\r\nThe case, admittedly, in search was powerful, but a little bit more nuanced, which is, it’s learning by doing, and the more queries you get, the smarter your search engine gets. And so, by suffocating rival search engines, it made it harder for them to get smarter and compete on quality with Google. We didn’t have those same issues here.\r\n\r\nIn fact, we had the opposite. We had the industry coming forward in trial saying that they were very upset, that they were unhappy with the level of quality. They were unhappy with the ROI that they were getting for their ads, and they wanted something better, and they couldn’t use it because Google was getting in the way. And in fact, it’s funny, I don’t think Google called a single witness that didn’t either work for Google or is paid by Google. And so, they had no one coming to their defense.\r\n\r\nTell me about the mechanics of putting a case like this together as the attorney general for antitrust. You decide, “Okay. We see some conduct. We’ve heard from a lot of publishers that they’re mad. We can see the distortion in the search market. We’re going to do both. We’re going to chase both of these down.”\r\n\r\nHow did you decide to prioritize these cases? And then I want to know how you decided to put them together, because no one ever really gets that view.\r\n\r\nThese are really hard cases, so what you do is kind of take a step back. For the investigation, you talk to the industry. You interview people. You learn about the products. You understand how they work, and then you send out subpoenas, and you get information and documents for Google — and we found incredible stuff where Google knew that what it was doing was wrong.\r\n\r\nIt talked about how owning this publisher server and these technologies and these ad exchanges would be like if Goldman Sachs owned the New York Stock Exchange. That’s an actual document that they wrote, that we featured in our case, and that actually made it into the opinion. And then you put all that evidence together, and then you realize that the impact here is great. Internet advertising is a huge business. This is not a side hustle. When you think from the advertiser’s perspective, advertising is one of the largest, if sometimes the largest, costs for most small businesses, in particular, small and medium-sized businesses who rely on internet advertising for lead gen and customer generation, and many even offline businesses rely on online advertising in order to get people coming in through the door.\r\n\r\nPeople who create content for the masses, whether they’re news publishers or any other type of content who doesn’t want to sell exclusively by subscription, need to sell advertising. In the internet world, you can’t sell advertising the Mad Men way and make money. You have to have technology and tools in order to clear all those impressions. Google understood early on that it could gobble up, through acquisition, all of the components to give itself power in those tools, and then it could use market manipulation, exclusivity, and other types of course of behavior in order to lock itself in, and that’s exactly what the court found.\r\n\r\nSo put me in the room. Are you screaming, “We’re going to go get Google”? Is it a presentation from your staff that says, “We think we have a case here. Here’s how we’re going to make it”? Was there a PowerPoint? How does this work?\r\n\r\nIt’s extremely deliberate. So the staff will investigate. We will, in my office, stay in tune and line with the staff and get updates on those investigations and make sure that we’re sending subpoenas and interview requests out to everyone in the industry. We hire experts, we get data. We analyze that data, and it’s expensive — very expensive actually.\r\n\r\nWhen we get closer to thinking there’s a problem, we start figuring out, “Okay, how do we tell this story, and does it survive scrutiny?” So we put ourselves through a very rigorous red team-style exercise to make sure that we’re right. The power of the government is extraordinarily significant, and we don’t wield it lightly. We want to make sure it’s going to hold up in the court of law, that we think we’re going to win, and that it’s the right case for the right reasons.\r\n\r\nThen you have to figure out, “Okay, how are we going to litigate this case? How are we going to write it in a way that, especially in a market like this, is filled with acronyms?” It’s incredibly complicated. Things move at the speed of milliseconds in terms of data. So how do we tell that story in a way that’s accessible?\r\n\r\nWe took a very interesting path, and I think this was consistent with our approach in a lot of these antitrust cases. Some lawyers will say, “You want to write a tight, short, crisp complaint.” I actually took a different view. My view is that we have all of this evidence. Let’s lay it all out there for the public and the court to see at the outset. Let’s err on the side of saying more rather than less, but let’s almost have three different stories in one.\r\n\r\nSo the way we would structure our complaints would be a very short intro, one page or two, that gives you the thematic opening to the case. This is the stuff that if you’re going to read one thing and you need to quickly understand what the case is about, you can read that one or two pages and understand it. In our case, we put it forward with that Goldman Sachs quote, because I think that really told the story.\r\n\r\nThen you have a longer executive summary, and this is for the person who’s got a little more time and is willing to read 15 pages and wants to get some more detail on what are the relevant markets and what are some of the key documents and what’s some of the harm. Then you have the antitrust nerds, like you, who want to read the whole thing from start to finish, and that’s the additional 80, 90, or 120 pages, whatever it might be in the case. That’s where you go really deep into the weeds and you can understand how the industry functions, where the documents are, what Google understood it was doing at the time, why it knew that it was behaving in an anticompetitive fashion, what the harm was, and how competitors were responding.\r\n\r\nThen we position all of that so that we can go to the court and say, “This is not a theory. This is not just based on a guess. This is based on a really serious inquiry. It’s based on data. It’s based on analysis. It’s based on internal documents and testimony, and the story is going to be coherent from start to finish.”\r\n\r\nThat trend towards really readable complaints that are essentially narrative is new, right? Well, it’s not so new. It’s new in the past five years, maybe. Do you think about, “Okay, well, this PDF is going to be on social media. I better give it a good hook”? Is that on your mind?\r\n\r\nNo. When we initially filed this case, we asked for a jury trial. So we thought about how this would play with the jury. My view is, if you can’t tell the story to a jury of your peers, how are you supposed to tell the story to the judge, and how are you supposed to tell it to the public? So I think we didn’t want to sacrifice sophistication, but on the other hand, having a good hook was really more about boiling something down to its core essence.\r\n\r\nIt’s what lawyers do. If you can’t make the case digestible, if you can’t make it easy to understand, you’re not likely to win. And so, if you have something that’s really complicated, how do you make sure that you’re not skimping on the nuance and the technicalities while at the same time saying, “What did they do that’s wrong? Why should they be held in violation of the law in a government lawsuit?”\r\n\r\nOkay, so Google owns the exchange. It represents the buyers. It represents the sellers. It owns the exchange in the middle. It buys and sells in its own exchange, and it manipulates it, and it knew what it was doing the whole time. To me, you don’t have to understand the technology to know that that’s wrong, and it’s really important to boil things down like that.\r\n\r\nWe did it in all of our cases, whether it’s this one, in the Ticketmaster one, and in our Apple case and others, and then we explain why it matters. It’s important for a court to understand why this matters to the public. Why are we going to the court and saying, “We’re asking you to take a lot of time and use your resources to try this case and figure out the right outcome. We believe in it, and here’s why, and here’s why it’s a good use of our resources and a good use of the court’s resources”?\r\n\r\nThere’s the complaint. There’s storytelling. There’s convincing the court it’s a good use of resources and surviving however many motions to dismiss Google wants to file. Then there’s the trial, in which you had to bring up a lot of experts to talk about price increases on the orders of pennies, but over millions and millions of transactions. There’s an insane number of acronyms that exist in the ad tech space. Google’s own products are basically named acronyms.\r\n\r\nThat was all very technical, and as I’ve watched a bunch of these antitrust trials over the years, that’s where it starts to fall apart. That you’ve got these very technical systems that might be working, might not be working, and then you’ve got these experts that everybody brings in to argue about whether prices went up or down a percentage based on some model they’ve created. Ad tech, in particular, is boring. Just inherently, the only people who care about it are people who work in ad tech, and they care about it a lot. But regular people, their eyes glaze over. How did you think about that in the course of actually being in the courtroom?\r\n\r\nSo first and foremost, you have to invest in the right team. When I started the antitrust division, I realized that we weren’t going to be successful unless we can convince courts, juries, and judges that we’re right. We had the best — in my view, and still do — antitrust lawyers in the world, but many of them didn’t have the experience of standing up in a courtroom and trying cases.\r\n\r\nThe vision that we brought to the antitrust division when I arrived was, “How do we take world-class antitrust lawyers and match them with world-class trial lawyers?” So we went out and built this elite core of first-chair trial lawyers, about 25 of them. These are people who have grown up in courtrooms: former US attorneys, assistant US attorneys, DAs, plaintiffs’ lawyers, and partners at law firms. How do we assemble folks who really can be that lead lawyer in first, second, and third chairs alongside the antitrust experts? And if you combine those two expertise, you can bring the sophistication and you can bring the storytelling in court.\r\n\r\nSo we built that, and we brought in incredible people. It was run by a woman named Hetal Doshi, who is one of my deputies and is just an extraordinarily gifted storyteller, lawyer, debater, and mastermind in the courtroom. Then we assembled this incredible team of what we called senior litigation counsel. I actually recruited a former partner of mine from private Big Law, a woman named Julia Wood, who ended up becoming the leading trial lawyer in the case, and Aaron Teitelbaum, who is a former prosecutor in the US Attorney’s Office, and then a number of others to help lead the trial team and go head-to-head with my former firm Paul, Weiss.\r\n\r\nIt sounds to me like you’re building a little law firm inside the Department of Justice. You’re describing a culture shift. You’re describing hiring and recruiting. Is that how people should think about it, that this is a little law firm that you ran?\r\n\r\nAbsolutely. Yeah, it’s a scrappy little law firm, certainly compared to the size of the big law firms, and we had incredible assets when I arrived. We just needed to shape them a little bit differently. So bringing in this trial unit, building a data scientist unit, boosting the core expertise that I thought we needed in order to go head-to-head with companies like Google and litigate two cases in a year and win both of them, while at the same time suing Apple, RealPage, Ticketmaster, and a number of other companies. So we needed to scale, we needed scope, and we needed depth. How you build your team is really important, and we invested a lot in that early on before we went to battle.\r\n\r\nI’m going to come back to this idea that you started a law firm and it was good at its job, because I think that’s hard for people to see. I think they see the Department of Justice, and you’re describing a unit within the Department of Justice that you built. You started a law firm. And that’s useful to me, but I want to come back to it.\r\n\r\nYeah, we built the world’s best antitrust boutique firm inside the Department of Justice, and we kicked ass.\r\n\r\nLike I said, we’re going to come back to it. The Department of Justice won on two of the three counts here. I just want to read you this quote, because I’m curious what you think this means. Google says, “We won half of this case, and we will appeal the other half. The court found that our advertiser tools and our acquisitions, such as DoubleClick, don’t harm competition. We disagree with the court’s decision regarding our publishers’ tools. Publishers have many options, and they choose Google because our ad tech tools are simple, affordable, and effective.”\r\n\r\nSounds to me like Google is as bad at math as it is in antitrust.\r\n\r\nOkay. So I’m curious about this.\r\n\r\nHalf of what? There were multiple claims inside all of those, right? So there were the publisher-side tools. There was the ad exchange, and then there were advertiser-side tools. We not only won on multiple claims involving both the publisher ad server and the ad exchange, but even though the court didn’t find a relevant market on the advertising tools, the court was quite clear that its power on that side of the market was relevant to understanding its power on the other sides of the market. So to say it’s spin would be a little charitable.\r\n\r\nWe’re onto the remedies phase now in both the search case and in the ad tech case. What do you want those remedies to be? The last time you were on, you couldn’t say, but you’ve told me you’re free now. What do you want those remedies to be?\r\n\r\nI’m free. Those remedies need to be structural and forward-looking. So structural means the company has too much power. It’s used that power, it’s abused that power, and particularly in the case of ad tech, it has conflicts of interest. Google represents buyers and sellers on the exchange and buys and sells on its own exchange. The only way to deal with that is to eliminate those conflicts of interest and to reduce its power.\r\n\r\nIn terms of forward-looking, we need to confront the market where it is today in light of a decade of anticompetitive behavior, and this is true in both search and in ad tech. The infrastructure, whether it’s search infrastructure and search advertising infrastructure or the ad tech infrastructure, is going to be used now going forward not only for current-day products, but also going forward as things morph into a web that includes a lot of AI-driven content and information and products.\r\n\r\nSo I think it needs to be structural. It needs to be definitive. It needs to be forward-looking. It needs to skate to where the puck is going, which, in this world, is a more AI-driven marketplace that still relies on a lot of the same infrastructure, just for different use cases.\r\n\r\nDo you think Google should be broken up?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nHow would you break up Google?\r\n\r\nIn these cases, the Department of Justice has asked for Google to sell its Chrome browser, which was critical to the finding in the search case. In the context of ad tech, I think, again, it should not be able to own the buy side and sell side and exchange all at the same time, and I think that anybody who has even a passing familiarity with securities, financial, or commodities markets will tell you that that’s just table stakes.\r\n\r\nSo Google owns DFP, which stands for DoubleClick for Publishers. That’s what websites run to get the ad inventory. They own AdX, which is the exchange, and they own their own tools which advertisers use. Which of those would you want Google to sell?\r\n\r\nI think that’s going to require a little more work to figure it out. But I do worry about them owning the publisher-side tools, and then we’d worry about them recreating a lot of the same advertising and exchange tools and then creating that functionality somewhere else in the marketplace, like in a browser, for example.\r\n\r\nSo you need to have really good fencing-in remedies, as we call them in the industry, and other kinds of anti-circumvention provisions. I also do think that when you look across both cases, it’s quite clear that their strength flows from the small and medium-sized businesses that advertise on AdWords. That’s their core fire hose of demand, and that has been built now through two markets where they’ve been found to have violated the antitrust laws. So I think you need to take a very careful look at AdWords.\r\n\r\nI think an independent AdWords would be extraordinarily powerful and would address all of those conflicts of interest quite quickly. Now, ultimately, it’ll be up to the folks who are in the DOJ today and the state attorneys general to make that determination, just to be very clear. It’s out of my hands. I no longer have a say in the matter, but I think there’s a lot of value to be created.\r\n\r\nI think also — and Wall Street is now confronting this across a lot of different industries — that these conglomerates, by accumulating, acquiring all these assets, have actually destroyed a lot of value. You’d actually have more value created overnight, frankly, if you start divesting assets. You can look at what General Electric did, for example — voluntarily, not for antitrust reasons, but for business reasons.\r\n\r\nYou look at a company like Google, and just to be very clear, this asset wasn’t part of the case, but if Google divested YouTube, the Mag Seven would become the Mag Eight overnight, and you’d probably unlock a lot of shareholder or market value. There are two separate discussions. One is what needs to be done for the purposes of resolving the antitrust case, and I think there are structural remedies in terms of breakup that should be and will be on the table.\r\n\r\nThen there’s the second question, which is just from an efficiency and market perspective: are these companies too big? And are they locking up too much value or stifling too much value by holding onto assets that would be worth a lot more on their own?\r\n\r\nDo you think there’s a Google left if you peel off all those pieces? Again, I keep coming back to the open web. The open web right now relies on Google. It’s the number one referrer of traffic to websites. It is the number one monetization engine for all of those websites. Chrome is the dominant browser. You break that company up into a hundred little pieces. What’s left? Does the web persist, or does it all just become AI training data?\r\n\r\nWell, I think the web may, sadly, be turning into AI training data regardless of whether there are antitrust remedies. The fact of the matter is, Google is going to continue to exist after this case, and it’s going to continue to be a really significant company, just as AT&T continued after its breakup.\r\n\r\nBut AT&T reformed itself, like the Terminator.\r\n\r\nWell, it kind of did, that’s true. But I will also say, quite interestingly, it was the Reagan administration that ultimately pulled the trigger on breaking up AT&T. There were multiple cases going back to the ‘50s that involved patent divestitures, licenses, and other things. But ultimately, it was the Western Electric case, and that separated the hardware from the line, right?\r\n\r\nIt used to be that you had to rent a rotary phone from AT&T with their proprietary plug and plug it into the wall. The DOJ got AT&T to sell off Western Electric to break the hardware up from the line. And guess what? We saw tons of innovation. Companies first started building the phones with buttons rather than rotors, and then you saw cordless phones, and eventually you saw wireless and smartphones. So I think it was great for innovation.\r\n\r\nThere’s an argument that if the government hadn’t broken up AT&T, we all might be walking around with iPhones that have big rotors on them that had to be plugged into your wall. So a lot of antitrust over the years has actually unlocked a lot of innovation. Now, throughout the ‘80s and beyond, a lot of those antitrust breakups, whether it was in oil or in telecommunications or other areas, resulted in the companies reforming themselves in a very Borg-like way. The company re-assimilated its old components and created AT&T. So I think there are good questions about whether we should let them reformulate, but I think it is indisputable, at least in my view, that these breakups have actually generated rather than destroyed value.\r\n\r\nThe iPhone is an interesting one, because it launched with a singular executive on stage, and then by the time it actually came out, it was AT&T once again. So you just see that the industry kind of re-rolled itself up into different kinds of companies, maybe with the same name. But what’s fundamentally interesting to me is Microsoft. The Microsoft antitrust case is in a way what allowed Google to exist, right? It allowed the open web to thrive. Do you see a challenger like that to Google that hasn’t been able to exist because Google is dominant in the places where it’s dominant?\r\n\r\nAbsolutely. So to me, antitrust is most important when you reach inflection points in the market. So the AT&T case preceded the emergence of the PC. There’s an IBM antitrust case that preceded the emergence of software and operating systems. The Microsoft case immediately preceded the internet era and the launch of Google.\r\n\r\nI think what enforcers and the antitrust lawyers are concerned about is that incumbents, seeing these new threats and these new inflection points coming, will use their power to slow them down and make sure that they can transfer their dominance from market A to market B. They can incumbent-advantage into this new technology. But that’s not what you want. What you want as an enforcer is you want these new, nimble companies to emerge without the kind of lethargy of a big monopoly aircraft carrier, and you want someone who can move quickly and decisively.\r\n\r\nSo if Microsoft had won its antitrust case, who knows what would have happened? Perhaps it could have owned the browser market. Perhaps it could have owned the search market. It could have owned all these businesses. But instead, companies like Google and others were allowed to thrive. It’s not lost on us when we put this in our Apple case that iTunes and the iPod, which was really the precursor to the iPhone, really got traction when it went from being a Mac-only product to a Windows product, too.\r\n\r\nWhen you can use your iPod at the time with your Windows computer, because iTunes was available, that was something that was made possible by the Microsoft consent decree that involved competing media players being on Windows. So all of these things interact with one another. We’re sitting here now on the dawn of this new era. You had Web 1.0 and 2.0, and now we’re moving to the AI-based web, where you interact with agents and all other cool stuff that you all at The Verge talk about all the time. We want to make sure that those new companies, those little tech companies, those startups, those other incumbents in other areas who see as an opportunity to diversify can come in here and invent new technologies and compete on the merits rather than running into obstacles.\r\n\r\nIf you look at both Google cases, the obstacles were manmade, kind of like our economic problems today. They’re not due to better innovation. They’re due to contractual restrictions. It’s Google paying Apple $20 billion to lock up search defaults, it’s Google tying products and services together or giving itself first look or last look on auctions, which is what we proved in the ad tech case, rather than having an open auction where anybody can win. It’s putting sand in the gears or bumps on the road to slow other people down rather than speeding themselves up to innovate in order to compete.\r\n\r\nSure, I buy that argument with Microsoft, maybe because I was young and Microsoft was the evil empire during that time. But Google was like a cute upstart company that had slides in the office. You wanted the open web to win. The web itself was a new technology. Apple was on the brink of death. Steve Jobs was going to save the music industry with Jimmy Iovine. You wanted the iPod to succeed. I don’t know if anyone feels the same way about Sam Altman and OpenAI. Is that the company you’re trying to protect?\r\n\r\nNo, no.\r\n\r\nThe AI industry is made up of trillion-dollar giants., right? It’s not a bunch of kids.\r\n\r\nThat’s a separate problem. But I think part of what we’re trying to do is we’re trying to go giant by giant and make sure that they can’t use their power in one market to dominate another. So if you look at where the antitrust cases are, let’s look at the Big Four right now across the two agencies. It’s Google, Amazon, Apple, and Meta. The idea is saying, “Okay, we’ve had these massive conglomerates who are locking up commerce and locking up business and innovation who have become these sort of essential platforms, and they’re making it hard for new folks to emerge.”\r\n\r\nWhether you root for OpenAI or against OpenAI is a separate question. You can’t say that there should be no more innovation or no more progress. We just want to make sure that the markets are as competitive as possible. That’s a separate question, in my view, from whether we need other kinds of restrictions, like on privacy or data use or copyright. I think there are a lot of important conversations to be had.\r\n\r\nBut once a company has so much power, it’s hard to have market-based solutions to any of those problems if you don’t have competition. So you got to start by saying, “Let’s make the market as competitive as possible, figure out how a competitive market and all the innovations that flow from that can result in advances and help maybe get people innovate on better copyright solutions or better privacy solutions.”\r\n\r\nThen if there are market failures or safety, privacy, and security issues that aren’t being addressed by the market, then you can put some lines on the road so people can drive in the right lanes. But I think none of that works unless you have a free, fair, and competitive marketplace.\r\n\r\nBoth of these cases went to trial during the Biden administration, but the DOJ under Donald Trump looks very different. Pam Bondi is the new attorney general, replacing your former boss, Merrick Garland, and you yourself were replaced by Gail Slater. So now, as we enter the remedies phase of both cases, it’s a very open question as to whether Trump’s DOJ will be as aggressive against Google as it was when you worked there.\r\n\r\nEarlier, we were talking about you building a little law firm at the DOJ and that law firm being really good. Is the little law firm at the DOJ still as good as the one that you had?\r\n\r\nI hope so. I think they’ve lost some folks, and my hope is that I will give them the benefit of the doubt that people who are there now are, I think, talented people, like Gail and the others who are running it. All signs are that they’re going to continue with their foot on the pedal doing good work. So if they do, I will be there to cheer them on, support them, and give them the credit they deserve, and that’s where I hope we’ll be.\r\n\r\nOf course I worry, right? We built something. It was really successful but fragile, and I think there’s been a lot of damage done — forget the antitrust division, just more broadly to the government — due to DOGE, which I have a lot of feelings about, as well as about the villainization of government workers. I think what I saw was very different from what a lot of people portray about government workers. These are people who are working harder than folks in the private sector for less money and, frankly, are under-resourced, significantly so.\r\n\r\nThe value that we created for the economy was extraordinary, and I will say we did it at the antitrust division at zero cost to taxpayers, and I ran a unit with a budget surplus every year. We ran solely on Hart-Scott-Rodino fees. These are the merger filing fees. We did it with, again, a budget surplus. So we ran it very carefully and responsibly.\r\n\r\nSo I hope they continue doing that, but I hope that they continue investing in and maintaining and fortifying the resources that we developed. And, of course, everyone should run it the way they want to with their own stamp, but I think what we did was pretty special.\r\n\r\nHas your group, or the DOJ at large, been affected by DOGE and the cuts?\r\n\r\nI don’t know exactly. My sense is it’s mostly what’s happened at the DOJ more broadly. There were reports they wanted to shut down our San Francisco and Chicago offices, which boggled my mind, because the San Francisco office was absolutely critical in a lot of our big tech cases, including both Google cases, and our Chicago office was a center of excellence for antitrust enforcement in the agriculture industry, which people care a lot about, especially farmers. Even from just a pure political perspective, that’s a widely popular program with people like Senator Grassley and others.\r\n\r\nSo I hope that smarter heads prevail and that they don’t do any of that. I don’t know that that was being driven by the antitrust division, but I think those are more of the DOGE-style efforts where people who don’t really understand how things work come in, feel like they need to break something in order to prove that they’re doing their jobs, and then end up causing more harm than good.\r\n\r\nYou ran a pretty independent operation from Merrick Garland, the attorney general under Biden. That seems to be going away in the Trump administration. There’s the unitary executive theory, that Trump is actually making all the decisions, and then all of his appointments are just extensions of him. Pam Bondi is firing attorneys and trying to wrestle control of various divisions. Describe how independent you were and how independent you perceive the current Antitrust Division, to be specific.\r\n\r\nSo we worked very well with the rest of the Department of Justice, including with the attorney general, and there is a culture which I think he was trying to restore, appropriately so, that enforcement needs to be done for the right reasons and not for political reasons. So I think creating centers of excellence inside the Department of Justice, giving prosecutors and lawyers the ability to investigate and bring cases that are right on the law and right on the facts, is the right way to do it. It’s consistent with the broader policy objectives of the administration and the attorney general.\r\n\r\nWe found, I think, the right balance, and it’s hard. I think a lot of the concerns that are occurring now are that by doing a seat-of-the-pants, political rolling-up of power — and taking away those principles of prosecution being done on the facts and the law in a way that is sufficiently distinct from political considerations — creates a risk of corruption and risks undermining the confidence in our judicial system.\r\n\r\nI think when it comes to the law, and when it comes to using the awesome power of the Department of Justice and its ability to prosecute private individuals and corporations, we need to make sure that we’re doing it responsibly. One is we’re holding bad actors to account regardless of their political influence, heft, or donations; and two, that we are doing it the right way for the right reasons.\r\n\r\nDo you think Gail Slater is sufficiently independent of Pam Bondi?\r\n\r\nI don’t know what’s going on in the DOJ. I have a lot of confidence in Gail. I know her well, and I think she is a good actor. My hope is that, left to her own devices, she will do an excellent job. But there are things that are happening in the administration more broadly that do concern me.\r\n\r\nWell, I asked that because our readers have reacted to this news with what I can only describe as nihilism. Not just some readers, but almost all of them. That was the reaction to our coverage of the case. It’s in the comments on our website. It’s in the replies to me on Bluesky with people saying, “Well, then Google will just buy themselves out of this. They’ll just write a check to Donald Trump, and the case will go away.” They think that this doesn’t matter because at some point, it’s going to hit some level of transactional Donald Trumpism, and that’s why they were all on stage with him at the inauguration. Do you think that view is credible?\r\n\r\nWell, I think we should watch and find out. I mean, so far, that hasn’t happened, at least in these cases. The DOJ is going to court on the Google remedies, and the FTC is going to court on the Facebook case. Frankly, let’s be clear, that shouldn’t be celebrated on its own. That’s the right thing to do. The cases should be brought for the right reasons, and people shouldn’t be able to buy their way out of antitrust cases through political donations and favors.\r\n\r\nNow, when you have Tim Cook, [Google executives] Sundar Pichai and Sergey Brin, Jeff Bezos, and Zuckerberg and others toasty and warm inside the rotunda on a cold day during the inauguration, it creates a perception that leads to the reaction that your readers are having. That’s why those kinds of things matter. Those appearances undermine confidence and trust in the government, and that’s a problem. I sure as heck hope that they are not buying their way out of legitimate antitrust cases or other prosecutions. Only time will tell.\r\n\r\nYou said this two-word phrase earlier. You said “little tech.” That’s an Andreessen Horowitz phrase. That’s a phrase they use to describe how much they want to see things like NFTs on the iPhone being sold without Apple’s 30% tax. That’s a real thing they want. That’s a thing they used to describe Google’s dominance of the web.\r\n\r\nJD Vance has very specifically said that Google was a problem for him when he was a VC. At one point, he said Lina Khan was the only good member of the Biden administration. That’s the former chair of the Federal Trade Commission. That’s one side of the tech industry. Then there’s the oligarchs and there’s MAGA, the general MAGA movement, which is very populist. There are some weird lines between all three of these.\r\n\r\nWe just covered an antitrust event put on by Y Combinator where Lina Khan took a selfie with Steve Bannon. I would have never expected this in the past, but these are the new kind of addled lines. As you look at these cases and see how they’re going to move through the system, how do you think that’s going to break down?\r\n\r\nSo listen, let me start by saying that when I was in office, I was fortunate to have bipartisan support for antitrust, and that was a good thing. I don’t view that as a problem. I view that as a rarity, and an unfortunate rarity in today’s society, where you actually can have agreement on things among people who sit on both sides of the aisle.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, I had Republicans and Democrats who were unhappy with what we were doing, and it just didn’t neatly break down along neat political lines, and that’s fine. I think if that’s the case for antitrust, that’s a good thing, and we shouldn’t shy away from that. Of course, there’ll be differences and people might do different things or have different motivations for what they’re doing, but so long as they’re done for legitimate policy and law enforcement reasons, I think I’m pleased that we have actual continuity.\r\n\r\nI think it’s something we should celebrate rather than reject, but I also understand at the same time why there’s a degree of distrust and concern. Again, when you see these modern-day oligarchs in the rotunda giving money and trying to buy their way out of antitrust cases, it raises concerns. We should not have a government that’s coin-operated that way, and hopefully we won’t.\r\n\r\nCoin-operated is a good phrase. We’ve been calling it “gangster tech regulation,” because it just feels like there’s just a lot of threats and leverage and people are paying each other off, and that’s how it’s going to end up.\r\n\r\nBut just so I can be an equal-opportunity critic, I was just as critical, and still am, of the role that Google had in the Obama administration. They were way too cozy with the Obama administration. They were in and out of that White House like they lived there. I think it wasn’t right then and it’s not right now.\r\n\r\nLet me ask you about the other law firm in the government that pursues antitrust cases. That’s the Federal Trade Commission. I’ve got you here now, and I have to ask you about the Meta case that’s ongoing right now that’s run by the FTC. That case, I believe, was filed in the first Trump administration, pursued by Lina Khan’s FTC, and now it’s being taken to trial by the Trump FTC. Straightforwardly, is the FTC as good of a law firm as the DOJ?\r\n\r\nI think they’re pretty damn good. I know some of the people over there. Their head of the Bureau of Competition was one of our leads on the Google ad tech case at the DOJ, and they have some excellent lawyers over there. They did during our admin, and they do now. I will also note for the record, I’m a proud alum of the FTC. I started my career as a lawyer there.\r\n\r\nSo they’re a terrific group of people. They’re excellent litigators. They have a wonderful litigation team on the Meta case. By all accounts, they’re doing a pretty good job in court. It’s too soon to say how it’s going to result, but I think they’ve done a good job so far, an excellent job, in terms of putting on good witnesses and surfacing the right documents. So yeah, I’m a big fan of the FTC, and I will remain so. Hopefully, the FTC will continue to exist as an independent agency, but we’ll have to see.\r\n\r\nWe’ll come to that. I actually disagree with you, and I was hoping you would take the bait.\r\n\r\nI’ve been watching the Meta case very carefully. That case seems way harder than either of the two Google cases that you managed to win, because Google runs in an open ecosystem. It has to make deals with third parties. There’s lots of evidence in the various Google cases of its emails, of its contracts, of how it deals with Android vendors and Apple and whoever else.\r\n\r\nGoogle is also just chattier as a company, it seems, even though they had gotten some trouble suppressing evidence. Meta, on the other hand — the FTC has struggled and continues to struggle to even describe what Facebook is. The market definition tripped this case up so badly that, at one point, it went away, and they had to refile the complaint.\r\n\r\nAnd now we’re in court, and the FTC is claiming that Meta has no competitor, save Snap and some tiny social network called MeWe. And to me, that feels like a strategic blunder. We’re struggling to even define what this company is that we say is dominant. How would you have done that differently?\r\n\r\nWell, I don’t know if I would do it differently. Let me just try to give you a sense of what I think they’re trying to say, which is that a social graph is different than a performance graph. And so, if you think about YouTube and TikTok, it’s about an audience connecting with people that they want to perform for them, whether that’s singing and dancing or podcasting, or whatever people on TikTok do, which is a combination of all of them. It’s about being entertained or informed by people that you generally don’t know, but admire or interested in hearing from.\r\n\r\nI think the FTC is seeing that as distinct from connecting to people that you do know, friends and family. And so, the social graph or the perspective of communicating and sharing family pictures and reconnecting with people from your school and communities, and it’s different — using the tools for different reasons.\r\n\r\nWhat the commission is saying is that that’s how Facebook views it internally, and that’s how they’ve distinguished themselves, and that’s why they view themselves as different from a TikTok, for example, or YouTube, and essentially offer different functionality for different purposes, and so that the two coexist. Now, I see you smiling as if you don’t necessarily agree, but I think it’s a factual question.\r\n\r\nI’m just saying, take the compliment! I’m saying you did a better job in your cases than they did in this one. How would you have done this one better? Would you have pursued that theory of the case?\r\n\r\nPerhaps. I think it is a plausible, good theory, which is that social graphs are different than what TikTok does, and I think one of the things that they really have going for them is the documents in those cases are fire. It’s not as if they just made a better product, according to the FTC. What the commission is saying is that they said, “Shit, the biggest threat to us is if somebody starts peeling off messaging and photos and other things that are central to our social graph-based product, and then they go off.”\r\n\r\nAnd that’s what Instagram and WhatsApp were doing according to the FTC. They were off-ramps. They were a way to start building bridges to people creating new networks. They were disintermediating. They were removing friction. They were filling them out, whichever metaphor you want to use. And instead of competing by building their own stuff, which [Meta was] trying to do and not doing as good a job, the FTC is saying they just went and bought them, and said so in their documents that, “We’re buying them because they’re a competitive threat, and we’re going to neutralize that competitive threat so that we can maintain our power.” I think if the court focuses on the words of the executives, they have a very strong case.\r\n\r\nI think I look at it and I say, “Well, Facebook today is not just about friends and family. It’s a feed full of stuff from all kinds of people, and TikTok is a competitive threat to them.”\r\n\r\nYeah. But I think there’s one thing that’s true in antitrust that’s worth distinguishing: Just because they compete for some part of the business, doesn’t mean they compete for all of it. While there may be aspects of Facebook or Instagram that do what TikTok does, it’s not true that TikTok does everything that Facebook does, or a big chunk of it, which is the friends and family piece. And from my perspective, that’s where the FTC is focusing.\r\n\r\nAndrew Ferguson is the new head of the FTC. Donald Trump has fired the Democratic commissioners of the FTC. That appears to be illegal under a 100-year-old statute that lots of people want to talk about, but we’ll set aside for the purpose of this conversation.\r\n\r\nAndrew Ferguson is a fire breather. He got that job by writing a letter to Donald Trump, basically saying everything Lina Khan did was bad. I mean, I’ll just read the quotes: “Lina Khan should stop abusing FTC enforcement authorities as a substitute for comprehensive federal privacy legislation. She should stop bringing novel and legally dubious consumer protection cases. I will end Lina Khan’s politically motivated investigations.”\r\n\r\nAnd here we are. We’re pursuing the Meta case, and none of that stuff is coming up in this case. None of the censorship stuff that Trump likes to talk about is coming up in this case. Do you think that this case is still as legally clean as it was before? Because right now, it seems like leverage, and if anything gets a deal made for exit ramp, it feels like this case is right on the line.\r\n\r\nWe can voice those concerns, and as I said earlier, I think when you have an administration that presents itself as being coin-operated, it opens itself up to that degree of distrust and concerns about whether things are being done for the wrong reasons.\r\n\r\nThey’re trying the case the right way. They’re not trying it like a coin-operated operation. They’re trying it the same way that Trump 1 did, Chair Khan’s FTC, and now Chair Ferguson’s FTC.\r\n\r\nIn terms of what they’re putting in front of the court, I think it’s very much in line with how it’s been done, and it’s being tried the right way in a very sensible, professional, legal manner, one that does not appear politically motivated. What happens in the future, and whether they settle something or take the 25-cent coin in the slot and spit out a Dr Pepper full of settlements, I don’t know, but I hope they don’t.\r\n\r\nIt’s a couple million dollars to the library, actually, that’s how much it costs. Speaking of a couple million dollars to the library, Tim Cook did pay $1 million for Donald Trump’s library. Apple is the next big case. That’s your case at the DOJ, saying Apple uses the power of iOS to prevent all kinds of applications from being developed. My favorite part of it is the limitations on CarPlay. We talk about CarPlay a lot on this show for some reason.\r\n\r\nHow do you think that one’s going to go now?\r\n\r\nWe’ll see. I hope they do the right thing for the right reasons. It’s a strong case. It is an important case, and Apple is a company that has extracted a lot of money from a lot of people for the same product without necessarily corresponding innovations. Once it was this incredibly visionary and innovative company. A lot of what they’re doing now, at least our case [alleges], was restricting the innovations of others in order to maintain their own position and be able to extract fees — fees from developers, fees from Google in terms of its search engine, fees from banks in terms of basis points on tap-to-pay transactions, from car manufacturers and others.\r\n\r\nIt is an extraordinarily profitable and extractive business, but it’s maintaining that position by restricting the ability of others to innovate. And so, our case was not about saying, “Apple, you have to stop innovating.” It’s, “Apple, go innovate the way you want to. Just stop telling others how they can and can’t build their products and services.”\r\n\r\nThis has been a theme of this conversation, the idea that the power of law enforcement is enormous, the government should wield it responsibly, and there’s a right way to do these things. There’s also a wrong way to do these things. There’s a way to tell these stories.\r\n\r\nThis government, in particular, is not prone to using that power responsibly. We see it all over the place. We see the irresponsible use of power, power for power’s sake, all over the place with the Trump administration, particularly here in the second term. These huge companies in the first term were checks on that power; they were the ones who stood up and said, “No, we’re actually not going to do this.”\r\n\r\nThe stock market tanking, at least in the first term, would sometimes stop Trump from indulging his worst impulses, maybe less so in the second term, but it still seems to have some effect on him. Tariffs, imports, the tech industry, AI — all that stuff is wrapped up in these huge companies. Do you think there’s any danger at all in all of these enforcement actions being taken against the very companies that might otherwise check the worst impulses of this administration?\r\n\r\nNo. I think that’s exactly the wrong way to think about it, which is that we are at our best when we have rule of law. People come to this country because there’s rule of law. What distinguishes us from a tin-pot dictatorship or banana republic is not that we have a Constitution, but that we have checks and balances and the court system to enforce the laws.\r\n\r\nSaying that we need to allow these companies to become powerful, well — they were showing up to the inauguration, and they’re giving money. And they’re doing business with China. It’s not as if they are an extension of the US military or the US government. They’re private companies, and those institutions should speak up for the rule of law, because, frankly, they benefit. They might not like our antitrust case, but their ability to make the kinds of profits for themselves and their shareholders flows from having an open marketplace and society.\r\n\r\nI think what’s happening now is a going after all of those institutions that function as checks, independent businesses rather than having nationalized businesses. It’s independent law firms rather than having nationalized law firms. It’s courts. It’s universities that seek truth through scientific research and political thought and debate and speech, and many others.\r\n\r\nThose institutions matter a great deal to our freedom. They matter a great deal to our progress, and it is one of the reasons, if not one of the most significant reasons, that people want to do business in the United States, that they want to come to school here, that they want to build their businesses here, that they want to rely on our currency: because they believe in the stability of our nation.\r\n\r\nOnce we start undermining that trust, and once we look like we’re coin-operated, once we look like that, once people are concerned that the rule of law no longer has power and effect, they’re going to stop investing in the United States and they’re going to find other partners, and that is going to put us at a major disadvantage and set us back decades, if not more.\r\n\r\nIf people listening to this hear you and they’re inspired by it, what do you think folks can do?\r\n\r\nDon’t compromise on your core principles.\r\n\r\nFocus on what matters. The rule of law matters. Hold your leaders accountable. Vote. Make sure that elections are fair. Make sure that your voices are heard.\r\n\r\nWe can’t be complacent, and I think sitting back and letting somebody take our democracy bit by bit, institution by institution, is only going to result in there being nobody left to fight.\r\n\r\nSo if you see something that’s wrong, stand up for [what’s right]. I think whether it’s a university or a law firm or a judge, we need to stand up for our independence, and I think that includes making sure that our courts have the freedom to reach decisions; that the executive branch follows the directions of our courts, as our Constitution demands; that our institutions, like universities, have the freedom to seek out truth; that our law firms are free to defend, without reservation or hesitation, independent actors from government overreach. That’s how our system works, and we need to protect it.\r\n\r\nIt’s rare that a conversation on antitrust ends with a stirring call to defend the Constitution, but I think that’s where we are now.

CEO Aravind Srinivas tweeted that you can use the assistant to answer questions and have it begin tasks like writing emails, playing music or shows, and setting alerts.\r\n\r\nMany AI companies have introduced or teased voice assistants as part of their offerings, but there's a good reason why Perplexity might be jumping on this for its iOS app in particular. Apple's own AI, called Apple Intelligence, has suffered a series of delays since it was announced in 2024. The company has pulled commercials meant to highlight its advanced AI offerings since the features weren't actually available for users, and it's shifted its top AI leader.\r\n\r\nThe ChatGPT integration with Siri is live (you may need to enable it in your settings), but for the most part, Apple users are still waiting on the truly smarter Siri that Apple promised. That's where Perplexity's iOS mobile app could be a viable alternative, especially for those wanting advanced voice capabilities.\r\n\r\nVoice modes and mobile apps are two of the ways that AI companies are pursuing in the hopes of winning customers in a crowded market. Perplexity announced on Thursday that its app will come automatically preloaded on the new Motorola Razr phones. ChatGPT launched an advanced voice mode last August after initially pausing the project when a teaser video showed the AI voice to be eerily similar to Scarlett Johansson's voice. Johansson said she did not give the company permission to use her voice, amplifying concerns from actors about how their work is used in the creation of AI.\r\n\r\nIf you're not seeing the voice assistant as an option in your Perplexity app, try updating your app through the Apple app store. Perplexity offers a free plan and paid plans with higher usage limits. Perplexity can use the information you give it for training purposes, but you can opt out in your settings. You can check out the full privacy policy for more information.\r\n\r\nFor more, check out our full review of Perplexity and our top picks for the best AI chatbots.", "tags": [1, 6]}}, {"model": "blog.article", "pk": 134, "fields": {"title": "iPhone 16 Ad Highlights a Key Advantage Over Android Smartphones", "author": "Joe Rossignol", "description": "Apple today shared a new ad that highlights a key advantage that iPhone 16 models have over Android smartphones: the Ceramic Shield.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple says the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max displays are all protected by the latest…", "content": "<div class=\"ugc--2nTu61bm minor--3O_9dH4U\" data-io-article-url=\"/2025/04/24/iphone-16-trust-issues-ad/\">\r\n    <p>Apple today <a href=\"//www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdR32VJQ6aE\">shared a new ad</a> that highlights a key advantage\r\n        that iPhone 16 models have over Android smartphones: the Ceramic Shield.</p>\r\n  \r\n    <div class=\"video-wrapper\">\r\n      <iframe \r\n        src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gdR32VJQ6aE?si=itLlgheWt0fqR26E\" \r\n        title=\"YouTube video player\" \r\n        frameborder=\"0\"\r\n        allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"\r\n        allowfullscreen>\r\n      </iframe>\r\n    </div>\r\n  \r\n    <br>\r\n    Apple says the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max displays are all protected\r\n    by the latest-generation Ceramic Shield material, which is advertised as being \"2x tougher than glass on any other\r\n    smartphone.\"\r\n  \r\n    <p>In the new \"Trust Issues\" ad, a father hands his iPhone to a stranger and asks them to take a photo of his family\r\n        at a carnival.

In the decades since that bright summer day in August 1963, many other Americans have tried to use the model of protest to achieve their political goals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut do protests work?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor sponsor-free episodes of Consider This, sign up for Consider This+ via Apple Podcasts or at plus.npr.org.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEmail us at considerthis@npr.org.\r\n\r\nSponsor Message\r\n\r\nThis episode was produced by Megan Lim It was edited by Courtney Dorning.

Become an Insider and start reading now.\r\n\r\nGoogle's artificial intelligence chatbot Gemini has seen a massive spike in its user numbers, but its usage levels are still way behind rivals like ChatGPT and Meta AI, data revealed in court this week showed.\r\n\r\nAs of late March, Gemini logged 350 million monthly active users and 35 million daily active users, according to a slide displayed by Google attorneys on Wednesday during day three of a court hearing to determine how to remedy the tech empire's illegal online search monopoly.\r\n\r\nThe user data was shown by Google in a Washington, DC, federal courtroom during testimony by Sissie Hsiao, who until earlier this month served as the head of Gemini and led the effort to create the chatbot. The Department of Justice called Hsiao as one of its witnesses in the antitrust case.\r\n\r\nGoogle showed the data as a way to highlight the competitive nature of the generative AI space. Gemini launched in 2023 and though its daily usage has nearly quadrupled from the 9 million daily active users it recorded in October of last year, OpenAI's ChatGPT and Meta AI were still leading the pack, the slide showed.\r\n\r\nThe Google slide estimated ChatGPT's monthly active users at 600 million and Meta AI's at 800 million.\r\n\r\nGoogle displayed this slide during the remedies phase of the company's search antitrust case. Google\r\n\r\nIn a January earnings call, Meta CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg — who testified last week in his company's own antitrust trial — said that Meta AI's usage \"continues to scale\" with more than 700 million monthly active users.\r\n\r\n\"I expect this is going to be the year when a highly intelligent and personalized AI assistant reaches more than 1 billion people, and I expect Meta AI to be that leading AI assistant,\" Zuckerberg said.\r\n\r\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said this month during a TED interview that ChatGPT had 500 million weekly active users and added that the chatbot was \"growing very rapidly.\"\r\n\r\n\"You told me that like doubled in just a few weeks,\" head of TED Chris Anderson told Altman. \"I said that privately, but I guess…\" Altman replied, before trailing off.\r\n\r\n\"It's growing very fast,\" he added.\r\n\r\nWhile on the witness stand in Google's antitrust case, Hsiao testified about the fast-changing pace of the generative AI world.\r\n\r\nThe so-called remedies phase of the court battle between Google and the DOJ kicked off on Monday and it could result in a massive shake up of the $1.8 trillion tech behemoth.\r\n\r\nUS District Judge Amit Mehta will ultimately determine Google's fate after he ruled in August, following a 10-week trial, that Google violated US antitrust law in maintaining a monopoly with its online search business.\r\n\r\nIf the DOJ gets its way, Google could be forced to sell off its prized Chrome web browser, end its exclusive deals with Apple and others to make Google the default search engine on web browsers and smartphones, and share search data with competitors.\r\n\r\nJustice Department lawyer David Dahlquist said in his opening statement on Monday that the court must prevent Google from using its search monopoly to dominate the AI market.\r\n\r\nGoogle lawyer John Schmidtlein argued ChatGPT is doing just fine.\r\n\r\nThe court hearing is slated to run three weeks. The judge is expected to issue his remedies ruling by the end of the summer.\r\n\r\nGoogle has vowed to appeal Mehta's ruling that declared the tech giant a monopolist.", "tags": [1, 13, 26]}}, {"model": "blog.article", "pk": 138, "fields": {"title": "Google might get broken up.

Become an Insider and start reading now.\r\n\r\nGoogle could get broken up. The response from marketers? Shrug.\r\n\r\nGoogle is battling separate rulings in two landmark US antitrust cases that found the company illegally monopolized the search and adtech businesses. While the exact remedies haven't yet been determined, Google is trying to avoid divesting assets like its prized Chrome browser and key parts of its under-the-hood adtech. Google's parent company, Alphabet, reports earnings on Thursday, when execs might speak more to investors about the cases.\r\n\r\nMarketers collectively spent more than $264 billion advertising on Google properties like YouTube and search last year. So, they must be champing at the bit at the prospect of the biggest player in the market amputating limbs and losing some power, right?\r\n\r\nRight?\r\n\r\nWell, not so fast.\r\n\r\nMany of the agitators pushing for a Google breakup are those who, unsurprisingly, stand to benefit the most: owners of demand-side platforms, ad servers, and supply-side platforms that directly compete with Google's adtech, or the publishers who feel their revenues have been decimated by unfair ad auction shenanigans.\r\n\r\nBut you'd be hard-pressed to find the CMO of a major brand talking about the matter publicly, or even privately putting much stock in it. For now, Google has large audiences that they desire and ads that appear to work.\r\n\r\nAs Rob Norman, the former chief digital officer of ad buying giant GroupM, wryly puts it: \"My feeling is advertisers enjoy a well-organized oligopoly — Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, and a few others.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is a drug people have become addicted to,\" said a marketer at a midsize company, who asked for anonymity to protect business relationships. \"Breakup or no breakup, people keep spending in these places because there's a lack of real alternatives that deliver.\"\r\n\r\nThat's not to say CMOs won't welcome a more marketer-friendly Google.\r\n\r\nMarketers and marketing consultants told BI that they were hopeful the outcome of both antitrust cases could force — or at least encourage — Google to be more transparent about its data and open up its systems to operate with other third-party tools. There's also a somewhat optimistic theory that any weakening of Google could make it less powerful when it comes to the table on negotiating major ad deals.\r\n\r\nThe rulings might be monumental in some corners of the ad industry, but at a time when CMOs face the prospect of a recession, tariffs, geopolitical uncertainty, DEI rollbacks, and major advertising budget cuts, dealing with the fallout of a potential Google breakup lies somewhere near the bottom of a marketer's to-do list.\r\n\r\n\"For enterprise CMOs, this is an issue to delegate,\" said Steve Boehler, founder of the marketing consulting firm Mercer Island Group.\r\n\r\nIt's also a precarious time for CMOs to take a public stand on any hot-button issue.\r\n\r\nGoogle didn't provide a comment for this story.\r\n\r\nAd industry insiders have long pushed for Google to open up its 'black box'\r\n\r\nMajor marketers may not immediately react, but the two cases still have the potential to shake up search and online advertising.\r\n\r\nRelated stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\r\n\r\nLet's quickly get you up to speed.\r\n\r\nDistrict Judge Amit Mehta is presiding over the Google search antitrust case. Mark Wilson/Getty Images\r\n\r\nLast summer, a judge ruled that Google violated US antitrust law by maintaining a monopoly with its online search business. The case returned to court again this week to decide what remedies could be imposed on Google. Those could include forcing it to sell Chrome, ending exclusive deals with the likes of Apple to be the default search engine on smartphones, or breaking off its Android mobile operating system.\r\n\r\nAnd last week, another judge ruled that Google holds an illegal monopoly in certain adtech markets. Google owns an ad server that publishers use to manage their inventory, buying tools that advertisers use to purchase ads, and an ad exchange that connects the two. This dynamic was akin, according to a Google manager cited in the ruling, to \"Goldman or Citibank owning the NYSE.\" The judge will set a hearing later to determine the remedies in that case, which industry experts believe could include the forced disposal of Google's publisher-side adtech business.\r\n\r\nThe huge caveat in both cases is that Google has said it plans to appeal, which could push back the implementation of any proposed remedy by years.\r\n\r\nFor some in the ad industry, the finer details are irrelevant because the Schadenfreude of seeing Google lose two successive antitrust cases in court is victory enough.\r\n\r\n\"Agencies, advertisers all understand that they are paying a premium for some lack of competitive advantage,\" said Dave Helmreich, CEO of the adtech company Triplelift.\r\n\r\n\"There is a desire that I've heard from some people in the industry for Google to just get punished for something,\" he added.\r\n\r\nAnd remedies aside, some industry insiders are hopeful that the ongoing antitrust scrutiny, both in the US and abroad, will mean Google will be more open to ceding to some long-asked-for demands. Could it finally let advertisers use their own preferred adtech to buy ads on YouTube, rather than having to go through Google directly? Might Google become less precious about letting advertisers audit their Google ad campaigns with third-party measurement tools rather than simply using Google's ad server?\r\n\r\n\"Advertisers want interoperability to foster competition and independence to allow accountability,\" said Gerry D'Angelo, senior advisor at McKinsey and former vice president of global media at Procter & Gamble.\r\n\r\nSuch changes could raise the bar for the entire adtech industry, said Arielle Garcia, a former agency executive now serving as chief operating officer of the nonprofit ad watchdog Check My Ads.\r\n\r\n\"Given Google's dominance in adtech, they have been able to establish the norms,\" said Garcia, who used the example of Google not enforcing \"know your customer\" requirements on the publishers it monetizes on its ad network. \"Why would a smaller player invest in quality or policy enforcement in a way a larger player has not?\"\r\n\r\nAs search evolves, Google's dominance is wobbling\r\n\r\nAs the Google search and adtech cases continue to wind their way through the lengthy court process, CMOs are monitoring broader changes in consumer behavior and how they should adapt their marketing budgets in response.\r\n\r\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai is navigating the company through huge changes in the way consumers use AI. Getty Images\r\n\r\nCompetitors like OpenAI's ChatGPT, TikTok, and Amazon are gaining on Google's search dominance. Research firm EMARKETER, a sister company of Business Insider, predicts Google will fall below a 50% share of the US search ad market in 2025, for the first time since it started tracking the space in 2008. This is partly due to competition from retail media platforms like Amazon, Walmart, and eBay, in addition to new players in the general search market.\r\n\r\n\"Google will be forced to compete harder and evolve one way or another, perhaps faster than it would have done anyway through the natural pace of change taking place in the market,\" said Andrew Warner, a marketing consultant and former CMO at brands such as Sony, LG, Monster, and Expedia.\r\n\r\n\"That in itself is probably a plus for marketers and the consumers they serve,\" Warner added.\r\n\r\nFor better or for worse, many marketers are OK with the status quo for now.\r\n\r\n\"There is not a common feeling that advertisers want Google to become less powerful because, in exchange for Google's seeming omnipresence, advertisers get peerless signals for efficient and effective media planning, buying, and optimization,\" said Nikhil Lai, senior analyst at the research firm Forrester.", "tags": [13, 20, 26]}}, {"model": "blog.article", "pk": 139, "fields": {"title": "Lorde's new song 'What Was That?' is full of references to heartbreak and MDMA.

Become an Insider and start reading now.\r\n\r\nOn the heels of her impromptu pop-up in Washington Square Park on Tuesday, which drew a crowd so large it was shut down by the NYPD, Lorde officially launched her new era of music on Thursday with the brand-new single, \"What Was That?\"\r\n\r\nThe synth-pop song arrives nearly four years after Lorde's third album, \"Solar Power,\" divided fans and critics with its bright acoustics and serene lyricism.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, \"What Was That?\" is fraught and jittery, like jolting awake from a dream. Cowritten by Lorde and Jim-E Stack and coproduced by the duo with Daniel Nigro — who made his name as a pop-star whisperer through his work with Olivia Rodrigo and Chappell Roan — the song was evidently inspired by fresh heartbreak.\r\n\r\n\"Late 2023. Back in New York. Deep breakup,\" Lorde wrote on her website to accompany its release. \"Stopping birth control. Every meal a battle. Flashbacks and waves. Feeling grief's vortex and letting it take me. Opening my mouth and recording what fell out… The sound of my rebirth.\"\r\n\r\nSince Lorde's breakthrough 2013 hit \"Royals,\" which she wrote when she was still a teenager, the now-28-year-old New Zealander has generally been social media-averse and tight-lipped about her personal life — so much so that the fact that she'd even been in a long-term relationship may have come as a surprise to many fans.\r\n\r\nOn \"What Was That?\", Lorde's guileless, introspective style of songwriting offers an avenue to trace her recent milestones and emotional arcs.\r\n\r\nThe song is teeming with references to her past work, real-life places, and drug-fueled flashbacks. Here's a close reading of the lyrics.\r\n\r\n'What Was That?' was likely inspired by Justin Warren, a music executive who Lorde was rumored to be dating\r\n\r\nRumors began swirling in 2016 that Lorde was dating Justin Warren, a promotions director at Universal Music who is roughly 17 years her senior.\r\n\r\nThough Warren denied reports of a romance at the time, the pair were photographed kissing on the streets of Auckland in 2020 and displaying more PDA in 2021.\r\n\r\nAlso in 2021, Lorde released the \"Solar Power\" track \"The Man With the Axe,\" which was widely interpreted as an open letter to Warren. She described the ballad as \"fragile, vulnerable,\" and \"very private.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm expressing a huge amount of love and affection for someone,\" she told Apple Music of the song. \"I sort of don't even like thinking about people listening to it because it's just for me.\"\r\n\r\nOn September 20, 2023, Lorde seemed to announce their breakup in an email to fans.\r\n\r\n\"I'm living with heartbreak again. It's different but the same. I ache all the time, I forget why and then remember,\" she wrote in her newsletter. \"I'm not trying to hide from the pain, I understand now that pain isn't something to hide from, that there's actually great beauty in moving with it. But sometimes I'm sick of being with myself.\"\r\n\r\nThis timeline would suggest that \"What Was That?\" was born in the wake of this breakup.\r\n\r\nNeither Lorde nor Warren ever publicly confirmed their relationship, but he's the only person she has been romantically linked to since she split from her first serious boyfriend, James Lowe, in early 2016. (Lowe apparently served as the inspiration for Lorde's 2017 sophomore album, \"Melodrama.\")\r\n\r\nThe chorus of 'What Was That?' features a reference to MDMA, drawing a connection to 'Melodrama'\r\n\r\nLorde performs during the \"Melodrama\" tour in 2017. Don Arnold/WireImage\r\n\r\n\"MDMA in the back garden, blow our pupils up,\" Lorde sings. \"We kissed for hours straight, well, baby, what was that?\"\r\n\r\nRelated stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\r\n\r\nMDMA is an abbreviation for the drug commonly known as ecstasy, which was popularized in the 2010s as a party stimulant.\r\n\r\nLorde previously revealed that she was using MDMA while making \"Melodrama,\" and the emotion that's most central to the album is \"ecstasy.\" (By comparison, she said she associates her debut album, \"Pure Heroine,\" with alcohol and her third album, \"Solar Power,\" with cannabis.)\r\n\r\nThere are lyrical callbacks to songs like 'Girl, So Confusing' and 'Perfect Places'\r\n\r\n\"I wear smoke like a wedding veil / Make a meal I won't eat,\" Lorde sings in the first verse of \"What Was That?\"\r\n\r\nThe first line is likely a reference to smoking cigarettes, which Lorde makes explicit in the song's chorus. (\"I remember saying then, 'This is the best cigarette of my life.'\") Cigarettes have historically been marketed as appetite suppressants, which may help explain the second line in the couplet.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Lorde has previously written about struggling with her body image and disordered eating habits, most notably for last year's \"Girl, So Confusing\" remix.\r\n\r\n\"'Cause for the last couple years / I've been at war with my body,\" Lorde sings in her verse of the Charli XCX track. \"I tried to starve myself thinner / And then I gained all the weight back.\"\r\n\r\nIn the 2023 email to fans that revealed her recent heartbreak, Lorde also wrote about experiencing inflammation across her body and concerns about her gut health. She also admitted to comparing herself to \"beautiful people\" who post photos of themselves online with \"arched backs and wet flower mouths.\"\r\n\r\n\"Everyone looks very thin. Just thinking that makes me feel tired and far away,\" she wrote.\r\n\r\nHeartbreak has been known to cause physical symptoms like nausea and loss of appetite, in addition to psychological effects like self-doubt and stress.\r\n\r\n\"What Was That?\" also recalls the hedonistic atmosphere of \"Melodrama,\" which Lorde once described as \"a record about being alone. The good parts and the bad parts.\" In particular, the album's closing track, \"Perfect Places,\" paints Lorde as a frenzied teenager who parties to cope with loneliness and existential angst. (\"I hate the headlines and the weather / I'm 19 and I'm on fire / But when we're dancing, I'm alright / It's just another graceless night.\")\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the second verse of \"What Was That?\" depicts the author as a woman possessed by grief, even when she's surrounded by a glamorous crowd.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know you're still with me / When I'm out with my friends? / I stare at the painted faces / That talk current affairs,\" Lorde sings.\r\n\r\nShe also name-drops Baby's All Right, a small music venue in Brooklyn: \"When I'm in the blue light, down at Baby's All Right / I face reality.\" In the song's outro, that lyric is tweaked to resemble her \"Melodrama\" philosophy more closely: \"When I'm in the blue light, I can make it alright.\"\r\n\r\n\"What Was That?\" also mirrors \"Perfect Places\" in its explicit reference to a formative age. Where Lorde once sang, \"I'm 19 and I'm on fire,\" she now reflects on her bygone youth, dazed and indignant: \"Since l was 17, I gave you everything / Now, we wake from a dream, well, baby, what was that?\"\r\n\r\nDream logic is a recurring theme in Lorde's discography\r\n\r\nThroughout her songwriting career — but especially in her debut album — Lorde has used dreams or dreaming as lyrical shorthand to illustrate encounters and experiences that feel surreal, shallow, doomed to end, or just beyond her reach.\r\n\r\nExamples of this motif include \"Royals\" (\"We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams\"), \"400 Lux\" (\"Dreams of clean teeth\"), \"Ribs\" (\"This dream isn't feeling sweet\"), \"Buzzcut Season\" (\"All the girls with heads inside a dream\"), \"Team\" (Living in ruins of a palace within my dreams\"), \"White Teeth Teens\" (\"You'll get the picture of your dreams\"), and \"Sober\" (\"When you dream with a fever / Bet you wish you could touch our rush\").\r\n\r\nMore recently, in the \"Solar Power\" track \"California,\" Lorde begs to be roused from the reverie of Hollywood, which she depicts as a fairytale-like world with lots of flattery and little substance (\"It all just a dream / I wanna wake up, I wanna wake up\").\r\n\r\nNow, \"What Was That?\" depicts Lorde as finally getting her wish — and being forced to face the consequences of living in a fantasy for so long, of bending to her self-described \"dreamer's disposition.\"", "tags": [18]}}, {"model": "blog.article", "pk": 140, "fields": {"title": "First Siri, now robots: Apple's AI chief loses control of another key project", "author": "Gabriel Erard", "description": "John Giannandrea, Apple's head of AI, has now lost control of the company's robotics project.

Apenas un mes atrás, el ejecutivo perdió la supervisión de la renovación de Siri, y ahora le ha pasado lo mismo con la iniciativa de robótica hogareña de la compañía californiana.\r\n\r\nSegún Mark Gurman, de Bloomberg, Apple le ha quitado a John Giannandrea el comando del proyecto con el que aspira a introducirse en una nueva categoría de dispositivos. El citado periodista indica que Tim Cook, CEO de la compañía, perdió la fe en que el susodicho pueda liderar la creación de nuevos productos.\r\n\r\nLa reestructuración pondrá al equipo de robótica de Apple bajo la supervisión de John Ternus, el actual jefe de ingeniería de hardware de la manzana. El susodicho es, junto con Craig Federighi, uno de los ejecutivos predilectos de Cook y su rol dentro de la empresa es de los más preponderantes. Incluso se especula con que Ternus podría ser el próximo CEO de Apple, aunque un cambio directivo de tal calibre aún estaría a años de distancia.\r\n\r\nDe acuerdo con el reporte, el traspaso del proyecto de robótica desde John Giannandrea hacia John Ternus se concretará antes de finales del corriente mes de abril. Apple aún no tiene nada que anunciar públicamente sobre su desembarco en el segmento de los robots para el hogar inteligente, pero este cambio de conducción podría servir para agilizar las labores de desarrollo.\r\n\r\nJohn Giannandrea pierde la supervisión de Siri y los proyectos de robótica de Apple\r\n\r\nJohn Ternus será el nuevo supervisor de los planes de robótica de Apple.\r\n\r\nSin Siri ni los robots hogareños bajo su supervisión, John Giannandrea continuará enfocado en el desarrollo de los modelos de inteligencia artificial subyacentes para los productos de Apple. Gurman indica que, si bien el ejecutivo no ha dado señales de abandonar la compañía, en Cupertino parece haber señales de que podría ver la puerta de salida en un futuro no muy lejano.\r\n\r\nJohn Giannandrea se unió a Apple en 2018 para ocupar el cargo de vicepresidente senior de estrategias de aprendizaje automático e inteligencia artificial. El ejecutivo llegó proveniente de Google, donde ejerció como jefe del buscador y de los primeros esfuerzos de la compañía en el campo de la IA.\r\n\r\nCon John Ternus tomando el control del proyecto de robótica, y con Mike Rockwell como nuevo jefe de Siri, Apple busca recuperar el tiempo perdido en dos áreas que pueden ser cruciales hacia el futuro. En lo que respecta a los robots domésticos, la iniciativa comenzó a ganar tracción tras la cancelación del Apple Car.\r\n\r\nRecordemos que Apple supuestamente trabaja en un dispositivo con un brazo robótico y una pantalla similar a un iPad. También se ha rumoreado el posible desarrollo de un robot acompañante para el hogar, similar al Amazon Astro o al Samsung Ballie. Sea como sea, ninguno de dichos productos verá la luz bajo la conducción directa de John Giannandrea.", "tags": [1, 20, 21]}}, {"model": "blog.article", "pk": 142, "fields": {"title": "The new Xiaomi TV A Pro 2026 is now available in Spain, and at a ridiculously low price.", "author": "Gabriel Erard", "description": "If Xiaomi can boast anything, it's having one of the broadest and most enviable product catalogs on the market, with an unbeatable price-performance ratio.

Y sus televisores no son la excepción. Por ello es una grata noticia que en España ya esté disponible la nueva línea Xiaomi TV A Pro 2026, que incluye modelos de 55, 65 y 75 pulgadas a un precio de risa.\r\n\r\nLas citadas versiones llegan con características idénticas, de modo que solo se diferencian por el tamaño de la pantalla. Los tres Xiaomi TV A Pro 2026 llegan equipados de un panel QLED con resolución 4K (3840 x 2160), una cobertura del 94 % de la gama de colores DCI-P3 y una tasa de refresco de 60 Hz. Eso sí, esta última puede alcanzar los 120 Hz a través del modo Game Boost durante la reproducción de contenidos vía HDMI, aunque solo en 1080p.\r\n\r\nEn cuanto a sonido, los Xiaomi TV A Pro 2026 incluyen dos altavoces de 10 W, y soportan Dolby Audio, DTS-X y DTS- Virtual. Mientras que en lo que respecta a conectividad y puertos, presumen de WiFi de doble banda, conexión para cable de red, Bluetooth 5.0, un USB 2.0 y cinco HDMI.\r\n\r\nOtro gran punto a favor de los nuevos televisores de Xiaomi es que llegan con Google TV como sistema operativo integrado. De modo que puedes descargar las apps de tus servicios de TV y streaming favoritos, sin requerir de un Chromecast o un Google TV Streamer. Eso sí, ten en cuenta que solo cuentan con 2 GB de memoria RAM y 8 GB de almacenamiento interno. Asimismo, son compatibles con las tecnologías de reproducción inalámbrica Google Cast, Miracast y Apple AirPlay.\r\n\r\nNuevos Xiaomi TV A Pro 2026, ya disponibles en España\r\n\r\nLos nuevos Xiaomi TV A Pro 2026 cumplen con los requisitos básicos de cualquier televisor moderno, así que es lógico que no ofrezcan nada revolucionario. El verdadero atractivo está, como dijimos al comienzo, en la relación entre precio y calidad que ofrecen los productos de la marca china. Después de todo, poder comprar una televisión 4K con pantalla QLED de hasta 75 pulgadas por menos de 1.000 euros convierten a estos equipos en grandes candidatos a sumarse a tu sala.\r\n\r\nDe lo único que debes asegurarte es de tener el espacio suficiente en las habitaciones donde desees colocarlos. Con diseños de bordes ultradelgados y acabados metálicos, pueden adaptarse sin mayores inconvenientes a cualquier lugar de tu casa. Y si no tienes muebles lo suficientemente grandes para que quepan, o no te generan demasiada confianza los pies de plástico, puedes montarlos a una pared sin problemas.\r\n\r\nSi te inclinas por la última opción, ten en cuenta que el Xiaomi TV A Pro 2026 de 55'' pesa 9,1 kg sin su base. En tanto que los de 65 y 75 pulgadas pesan 12,7 y 18,7 kilogramos, respectivamente.\r\n\r\nSi estás en España y quieres comprar los nuevos televisores de Xiaomi, puedes hacerlo directamente desde la tienda en línea de la marca.

If you had a\r\n        wordprocessor from a particular company, it worked with the printers from that company, and that was it. That\r\n        was the situation in the 1970s when some engineers at Xerox Parc — a great place for innovation but a spotty\r\n        track record for commercialization — realized there should be a better answer.</p>\r\n    <p>That answer would be Interpress, a language for controlling Xerox laser printers. Keep in mind that in 1980, a\r\n        laser printer could run anywhere from $10,000 to $100,000 and was a serious investment. John Warnock and his\r\n        boss, Chuck Geschke, tried for two years to commercialize Interpress. They failed.</p>\r\n    <p>So the two formed a company: Adobe. You’ve heard of them? They started out with the idea of making laser\r\n        printers, but eventually realized it would be a better idea to sell technology into other people’s laser\r\n        printers and that’s where we get <a\r\n            href=\"https://hackaday.com/2022/12/13/after-40-years-adobe-releases-postscript-source-v0-10-for-posterity/\">PostScript</a>.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p><span id=\"more-772676\"></span></p>\r\n    <h2>Early PostScript and the Birth of Desktop Publishing</h2>\r\n    <p>PostScript is very much like <a href=\"https://hackaday.com/2017/01/27/forth-the-hackers-language/\">Forth</a>,\r\n        with words made specifically for page layout and laser printing. There were several key selling points that made\r\n        the system successful.</p>\r\n    <p>First, you could easily obtain the specifications if you wanted to write a printer driver. Apple decided to use\r\n        it on their LaserWriter. Of course, that meant the printer had a more powerful computer in it than most of the\r\n        Macs it connected to, but for $7,000 maybe that’s expected.</p>\r\n    <p>Second, any printer maker could license PostScript for use in their device. Why spend a lot of money making your\r\n        own when you could just buy PostScript off the shelf?</p>\r\n    <p>Finally, PostScript allowed device independence. If you took a PostScript file and sent it to a 300 DPI laser\r\n        printer, you got nice output. If you sent it to a 2400 DPI typesetter, you got even nicer output. This was a big\r\n        draw since a rasterized image was either going to look bad on high-resolution devices or have a huge file system\r\n        in an era where huge files were painful to deal with. Even a page at 300 DPI is fairly large.</p>\r\n    <p>If you bought a Mac and a LaserWriter you only needed one other thing: software. But since the PostScript spec\r\n        was freely available, software was possible. A company named Aldus came out with PageMaker and invented the\r\n        category of desktop publishing. Adding fuel to the fire, giant Linotype came out with a typesetting machine that\r\n        accepted PostScript, so you could go from a computer screen to proofs to a finished print job with one file.</p>\r\n    <p>If you weren’t alive — or too young to pay attention — during this time, you may not realize what a big deal this\r\n        was. Prior to the desktop publishing revolution, computer output was terrible. You might mock something up in a\r\n        text file and print it on a daisy wheel printer, but eventually, someone had to make something that was\r\n        “camera-ready” to make real printing plates. The kind of things you can do in a minute in any word processor\r\n        today took a ton of skilled labor back in those days.</p>\r\n    <h2>Take Two</h2>\r\n    <p>Of course, you have to innovate. Adobe did try to prompt Display PostScript in the late 1980s as a way to drive\r\n        screens. The NeXT used this system. It was smart, but a bit slow for the hardware of the day. Also, Adobe wanted\r\n        licensing fees, which had worked well for printers, but there were cheaper alternatives available for displays\r\n        by the time Display PostScript arrived.</p>\r\n    <p>In 1991, Adobe released PostScript Level 2 — making the old PostScript into “Level 1” retroactively. It had all\r\n        the improvements you would expect in a second version. It was faster and crashed less. It had better support for\r\n        things like color separation and handling compressed images. It also worked better with oddball and custom\r\n        fonts, and the printer could cache fonts and graphics.</p>\r\n    <p>Remember how releasing the spec helped the original PostScript? For Level 2, releasing it early caused a problem.\r\n        Competitors started releasing features for Level 2 before Adobe. Oops.</p>\r\n    <p>They finally released PostScript 3. (And dropped the “Level”.) This allowed for 12-bit colors instead of 8-bit.\r\n        It also supported PDF files.</p>\r\n    <h2>PDF?</h2>\r\n    <p>While PostScript is a language for controlling a printer, PDF is set up as a page description language. It\r\n        focuses on what the page looks like and not how to create the page. Of course, this is somewhat semantics. You\r\n        can think of a PostScript file as a program that drives a Raster Image Processor (RIP) to draw a page. You can\r\n        think of a PDF as somewhat akin to a compiled version of that program that describes what the program would do.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>Up to PDF 1.4, released in 2001, everything you could do in a PDF file could be done in PostScript. But with PDF\r\n        1.4 there were some new things that PostScript didn’t have. In particular, PDFs support layers and transparency.\r\n        Today, PDF rules the roost and PostScript is largely static and fading.</p>\r\n    <h2>What’s Inside?</h2>\r\n    <p>Like we said, a PostScript file is a lot like a Forth program. There’s a comment at the front (%!PS-Adobe-3.0)\r\n        that tells you it is a PostScript file and the level. Then there’s a prolog that defines functions and fonts.\r\n        The body section uses words like moveto, lineto, and so on to build up a path that can be stroked, filled, or\r\n        clipped. You can also do loops and conditionals — PostScript is Turing-complete. A trailer appears at the end of\r\n        each page and usually has a command to render the page (showpage), which may start a new page.</p>\r\n    \r\n    <p>A PDF file has a similar structure with a %PDF-1.7 comment. The body contains objects that can refer to pages,\r\n        dictionaries, references, and image or font streams. There is also a cross-reference table to help find the\r\n        objects and a trailer that points to the root object.&nbsp; That object brings in other objects to form the\r\n        entire document. There’s no real code execution in a basic PDF file.</p>\r\n    <p>If you want to play with PostScript, there’s a good chance your printer might support it. If not, your printer\r\n        drivers might. However, you can also grab a copy of <a href=\"https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/\"\r\n            target=\"_blank\">GhostScript</a> and write PostScript programs all day. Use GSView to render them on the\r\n        screen or print them to any printer you can connect to. You can even create PDF files using the tools.</p>\r\n    <p>For example, try this:</p>\r\n    <div>\r\n        <div id=\"highlighter_651591\" class=\"syntaxhighlighter  plain\">\r\n            <table

If you had a wordprocessor from a particular company, it worked with the printers from that company, and that was it. That was the situation in the 1970s when some engineers at Xerox Parc — a great place for innovation but a spotty track record for commercialization — realized there should be a better answer.\r\n\r\nThat answer would be Interpress, a language for controlling Xerox laser printers. Keep in mind that in 1980, a laser printer could run anywhere from $10,000 to $100,000 and was a serious investment. John Warnock and his boss, Chuck Geschke, tried for two years to commercialize Interpress. They failed.\r\n\r\nSo the two formed a company: Adobe. You’ve heard of them? They started out with the idea of making laser printers, but eventually realized it would be a better idea to sell technology into other people’s laser printers and that’s where we get PostScript.\r\n\r\nEarly PostScript and the Birth of Desktop Publishing\r\n\r\nPostScript is very much like Forth, with words made specifically for page layout and laser printing. There were several key selling points that made the system successful.\r\n\r\nFirst, you could easily obtain the specifications if you wanted to write a printer driver. Apple decided to use it on their LaserWriter. Of course, that meant the printer had a more powerful computer in it than most of the Macs it connected to, but for $7,000 maybe that’s expected.\r\n\r\nSecond, any printer maker could license PostScript for use in their device. Why spend a lot of money making your own when you could just buy PostScript off the shelf?\r\n\r\nFinally, PostScript allowed device independence. If you took a PostScript file and sent it to a 300 DPI laser printer, you got nice output. If you sent it to a 2400 DPI typesetter, you got even nicer output. This was a big draw since a rasterized image was either going to look bad on high-resolution devices or have a huge file system in an era where huge files were painful to deal with. Even a page at 300 DPI is fairly large.\r\n\r\nIf you bought a Mac and a LaserWriter you only needed one other thing: software. But since the PostScript spec was freely available, software was possible. A company named Aldus came out with PageMaker and invented the category of desktop publishing. Adding fuel to the fire, giant Linotype came out with a typesetting machine that accepted PostScript, so you could go from a computer screen to proofs to a finished print job with one file.\r\n\r\nIf you weren’t alive — or too young to pay attention — during this time, you may not realize what a big deal this was. Prior to the desktop publishing revolution, computer output was terrible. You might mock something up in a text file and print it on a daisy wheel printer, but eventually, someone had to make something that was “camera-ready” to make real printing plates. The kind of things you can do in a minute in any word processor today took a ton of skilled labor back in those days.\r\n\r\nTake Two\r\n\r\nOf course, you have to innovate. Adobe did try to prompt Display PostScript in the late 1980s as a way to drive screens. The NeXT used this system. It was smart, but a bit slow for the hardware of the day. Also, Adobe wanted licensing fees, which had worked well for printers, but there were cheaper alternatives available for displays by the time Display PostScript arrived.\r\n\r\nIn 1991, Adobe released PostScript Level 2 — making the old PostScript into “Level 1” retroactively. It had all the improvements you would expect in a second version. It was faster and crashed less. It had better support for things like color separation and handling compressed images. It also worked better with oddball and custom fonts, and the printer could cache fonts and graphics.\r\n\r\nRemember how releasing the spec helped the original PostScript? For Level 2, releasing it early caused a problem. Competitors started releasing features for Level 2 before Adobe. Oops.\r\n\r\nThey finally released PostScript 3. (And dropped the “Level”.) This allowed for 12-bit colors instead of 8-bit. It also supported PDF files.\r\n\r\nPDF?\r\n\r\nWhile PostScript is a language for controlling a printer, PDF is set up as a page description language. It focuses on what the page looks like and not how to create the page. Of course, this is somewhat semantics. You can think of a PostScript file as a program that drives a Raster Image Processor (RIP) to draw a page. You can think of a PDF as somewhat akin to a compiled version of that program that describes what the program would do.\r\n\r\nUp to PDF 1.4, released in 2001, everything you could do in a PDF file could be done in PostScript. But with PDF 1.4 there were some new things that PostScript didn’t have. In particular, PDFs support layers and transparency. Today, PDF rules the roost and PostScript is largely static and fading.\r\n\r\nWhat’s Inside?\r\n\r\nLike we said, a PostScript file is a lot like a Forth program. There’s a comment at the front (%!PS-Adobe-3.0) that tells you it is a PostScript file and the level. Then there’s a prolog that defines functions and fonts. The body section uses words like moveto, lineto, and so on to build up a path that can be stroked, filled, or clipped. You can also do loops and conditionals — PostScript is Turing-complete. A trailer appears at the end of each page and usually has a command to render the page (showpage), which may start a new page.\r\n\r\nA PDF file has a similar structure with a %PDF-1.7 comment. The body contains objects that can refer to pages, dictionaries, references, and image or font streams. There is also a cross-reference table to help find the objects and a trailer that points to the root object. That object brings in other objects to form the entire document. There’s no real code execution in a basic PDF file.\r\n\r\nIf you want to play with PostScript, there’s a good chance your printer might support it. If not, your printer drivers might. However, you can also grab a copy of GhostScript and write PostScript programs all day. Use GSView to render them on the screen or print them to any printer you can connect to. You can even create PDF files using the tools.\r\n\r\nFor example, try this:\r\n\r\n%!PS % Draw square 100 100 moveto 100 0 rlineto 0 100 rlineto -100 0 rlineto closepath stroke % Draw circle 150 150 50 0 360 arc stroke % Draw text \"Hackaday\" centered in the circle /Times-Roman findfont 12 scalefont setfont % Choose font and size (Hackaday) dup stringwidth pop 2 div % Calculate half text width 150 exch sub % X = center - half width 150 % Y = vertical center moveto (Hackaday) show showpage\r\n\r\nIf you want to hack on the code or write your own, here’s the documentation.

She helped launch the Rift Herald in 2016.\r\n\r\nApplin has made its Pokémon Go debut, alongside its two original evolutions, Flapple and Appletun. With Applin, there’s a (kind of) new mechanic in the game that involves picking up items off the floor — something we saw vaguely tested during the April Fools’ 2025 event with Poké Balls.\r\n\r\nOur guide details how to find Applin and evolve it into its two evolutions, Flapple and Appletun, in Pokémon Go.\r\n\r\nHow to get Applin in Pokémon Go\r\n\r\nYou can find Applin the following ways:\r\n\r\nTapping on apple items on the floor that may spawn rarely (and more commonly around Mossy Lure Modules during the “ Sweet Discoveries ” event)\r\n\r\nComplete the “Sweet Discoveries” premium Timed Research (for $2) during the aforementioned event\r\n\r\nBut as of this writing, that’s it. There have been no confirmations about Applin appearing in other situations, so you’ll definitely want to keep your eyes peeled for any stray apple items on the floor.\r\n\r\nThe apples look like the below image.\r\n\r\nImage: Niantic\r\n\r\nNotably, Applin’s evolutions, Flapple and Appletun, both have Gigantamax forms — though it’s not available in Pokémon Go just yet. Both evolutions look the same when Gigantamaxed, but they get slightly different moves, with Flapple getting G-Max Tartness and Appletun getting G-Max Sweetness. The moves are different in Pokémon Sword and Shield, but given that one of them heal status conditions and the other reduces evasiveness, we don’t know how they’ll impliment these moves in Pokémon Go. All that being said, you may want to try to score as much Applin Candy as you can to prepare for the inevitable Gigantamax forms, if you like collecting them.\r\n\r\nHow to get evolutions Flapple and Appletun in Pokémon Go\r\n\r\nTo evolve Applin into Flapple and Appletun in Pokémon Go, you’ll need 200 Applin Candy and 20 of their special apples. Flapple requires Tart Apples and Appletun requires Sweet Apples.\r\n\r\nYou can get these special apple items by — you guessed it — tapping on the apples you find on the floor, but you also get one of each for completing the free Timed Research as part of the previously mentioned “Sweet Discoveries” event.\r\n\r\nGraphic: Julia Lee/Polygon | Source images: Niantic\r\n\r\nApplin actually has a third evolution: Dipplin, which was introduced during The Teal Mask DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. Additionally, Dipplin evolves again, turning into Hydrapple. However, neither of these Pokémon are in Pokémon Go yet. Since Applin made its debut a generation earlier in Pokémon Sword and Shield, it may be a bit before we see these extra evolutions.\r\n\r\nCan Applin be shiny in Pokémon Go?\r\n\r\nAs of this writing, no, Applin cannot be shiny in Pokémon Go. Like every other Pokémon in this game, its shiny form will come eventually, whether it’s from a Community Day or a different event.\r\n\r\nYou can see a preview of what the shinies for this evolution chain look like (via their Pokémon Home portraits) below.", "tags": [18, 20]}}, {"model": "blog.article", "pk": 146, "fields": {"title": "WhatsApp's privacy seemed bombproof.

En realidad no fue así, porque da igual que borres tus mensajes en WhatsApp: Google los guarda igual. Ahora el Tribunal Supremo ha recibido documentación de Google/Meta que ayudará en el proceso.\r\n\r\nEl auto es de momento secreto y no sabemos exactamente qué información han remitido estas compañías, pero podemos elaborar varias hipótesis para contestar a dos preguntas. La primera, ¿se ha logrado acceso a los mensajes borrados?. Y la segunda ¿cómo se han logado leer dichos mensajes?\r\n\r\nQué ha pasado. El fiscal general del Estado, Álvaro García Ortiz, fue imputado en octubre de un delito de revelación de secretos, como indicaron entonces en El Confidencial. La imputación está referida a la supuesta filtración a la prensa de los correos de la pareja de Isabel Díaz Ayuso o de haber dado órdenes a otros fiscales para que lo hicieran. El mismo diario informó en febrero de que el mismo día en el que se abrió la causa, García Ortiz borró los mensajes de WhatsApp de su móvil, lo restauró y cambió de dispositivo.\r\n\r\nPetición a Google y Meta. El Tribunal Supremo, indicaban en El País en enero, lleva tiempo intentando recopilar información sobre el caso. Se realizó una petición a las delegaciones irlandesas de Google y WhatsApp (Meta) a través de Eurojust, una agencia para la cooperación judicial en casos criminales. La petición realizada intentaba recuperar \"la información vinculada a aplicaciones de mensajería instantánea instaladas en dos dispositivos móviles de Álvaro García Ortiz, así como en una cuenta de correo electrónico\". Según El Mundo, esa petición acabó siendo reenviada a Estados Unidos después de que Irlanda le indicase que la petición de información debía hacerse a este país.\r\n\r\nUna carpeta ZIP. Según El Confidencial, el magistrado del Tribunal Supremo Ángel Luis Hurtado ha indicado que la recuperación de los datos parece haber sido exitosa. Google o Meta (no se especifica cuál) remitieron documentación en forma de una carpeta comprimida con formato ZIP. Estos nuevos datos, indica el magistrado en la resolución a la que ha tenido acceso El Confidencial, se analizarán pericialmente, y el resultado de esa investigación confirmará si la recuperación de los datos ha sido efectivamente \"exitosa\". es si han podido leer esos mensajes y cómo lo han conseguido. Hay varias hipótesis.\r\n\r\nHipótesis 1: metadatos. Durante la investigación, la UCO también registró los dispositivos electrónicos de la fiscal jefa provincial de Madrid, Pilar Rodríguez, señalan en 20Minutos. Rodríguez fue la persona con la que supuestamente mantuvo contacto García Ortiz en la imputación por el delito de revelación de secretos. Ella no borró sus mensajes ni restauró su móvil, así que la UCO sí pudo acceder a las conversaciones a través de su dispositivo, como señalan en El Confidencial. El contenido de la carpeta ZIP en poder del magistrado también podría haber sido remitido por Meta/WhatsApp, que no habría enviado los mensajes —no puede, teóricamente no tiene acceso a ellos—, pero sí los metadatos de esas conversaciones de García Ortiz. Dichos metadatos podrían servir para cotejar y contrastar los mensajes de Rodríguez, aportando así pruebas para la imputación del fiscal general.\r\n\r\nHipótesis 2: copias de seguridad sin cifrar. En WhatsApp los usuarios pueden hacer copias de seguridad de sus mensajes en servicios en la nube como los de Google Drive o Apple iCloud, pero atención: por defecto esas copias de seguridad no están cifradas. Son los usuarios los que deben proactivamente habilitar el cifrado en las copias de seguridad, y quizás García Ortiz no lo hizo. Eso hubiera provocado que Google, a la que se solicitó ayuda, pudiera acceder a esos datos para remitírselos al magistrado del caso.\r\n\r\nHipótesis 3: acceso físico al dispositivo. La forma más obvia de acceder a los mensajes de WhatsApp de un usuario es la de tener acceso físico a su dispositivo móvil. En ese caso expertos forenses pueden, con las herramientas oportunas, obtener la clave para descifrar los mensajes de la base de datos de WhatsApp, incluso si estos han sido borrados. Aquí García Ortiz borró los mensajes y restauró el terminal a su estado de fábrica, lo que probablemente hizo imposible recuperarlos desde el dispositivo aun teniendo acceso físicamente.\r\n\r\nEl cifrado de extremo a extremo está ahí. Hay que aclarar que WhatsApp lleva años haciendo uso de un protocolo de cifrado de extremo a extremo para todas las conversaciones. Solo quien envía el mensaje y quien (o quienes) lo reciben pueden leerlos, pero ninguna otra persona o entidad puede descifrar esos mensajes. Ni siquiera Meta, a través de cuyos servidores se envían y reenvían textos, imágenes, vídeo o cualquier otro tipo de contenido.\r\n\r\nSi quieres borrar tus mensajes, cuidado con las copias de seguridad. Los usuarios de WhatsApp no pueden hacer nada con los metadatos, que sí guarda Meta, pero sí con los mensajes si quieren borrarlos de forma efectiva. Como nos enseña este caso, no basta con borrarlos de nuestro teléfono: si hacemos copias de seguridad de nuestros mensajes, es importante activar el cifrado de dichas copias de seguridad.\r\n\r\nPero aviso especial sobre las copias de seguridad. Cuidado especial con el cifrado de las copias de seguridad, porque no funciona como el cifrado extremo a extremo. Las copias se cifran con una clave/contraseña que solo conoces tú, y que por tanto conviene que sea fuerte para no poder ser rota con ataques de fuerza bruta, por ejemplo. WhatsApp de hecho da la opción de crear una clave de 64 dígitos, pero... lo hace ella.\r\n\r\nSuspicacias. Aquí entra el debate sobre cómo gestionan esa contraseña de cifrado en Google/Apple/Meta, y si pueden descifrarla de algún modo para potenciales peticiones judiciales. Sea como fuere, la otra solución, por supuesto, es no hacer copias de seguridad de los mensajes a no ser que lo consideres absolutamente imprescindible. Todo este proceso levanta suspicacias sobre si la copia de seguridad es realmente vulnerable por parte de las propias Meta y Google/Apple.\r\n\r\nImagen | Consejo de Estado | Brett Jordan\r\n\r\nEn Xataka | Si la pregunta es si tu empresa puede añadirte a un grupo de WhatsApp del trabajo, la ley no deja dudas: depende de quién paga", "tags": [13, 18, 26]}}, {"model": "blog.article", "pk": 152, "fields": {"title": "Elon Musk’s Luck Runs Out", "author": "Hanna Rosin", "description": "For a while, it seemed as if DOGE Elon and Tesla Elon could exist in the same space-time continuum.

And I’m kind of sad for those folks\r\n        now who really believed in this environmental mission of the company. Those are the ones who are dumping their\r\n        Teslas.

You know, for lack of a better term, it’s kind of insane, honestly.</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">When I started covering Tesla, and I was a\r\n        young writer at Jalopnik—I started at the end of 2012. And one of the first things I did was my then–editor in\r\n        chief, Matt Hardigree, and I—we interviewed Elon Musk from the Tesla factory floor when they were trying to get\r\n        the Model S up and running.</p><gpt-ad\r\n        class=\"GptAd_root__pAvcS ArticleInjector_root__I7x9v s-native s-native--standard s-native--streamline\"\r\n        format=\"injector\" sizes-at-0=\"mobile-wide,native,house\" targeting-pos=\"csi-ad-5\"\r\n        sizes-at-976=\"desktop-wide,native,house\" id=\"gpt-unit-7\"></gpt-ad>\r\n    <div class=\"ArticleInjector_clsAvoider__dqIAm\"></div>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">You know, the first car was the Roadster. And\r\n        that was kind of a science project, honestly. It was a Lotus Elise stuffed with laptop batteries, more or less.\r\n        And the Model S was their first real car. And they were trying to get it ramped up. And we talked to him, on the\r\n        factory floor. And I remember, you know, him being at the time very tired but, you know, charming, smart, but\r\n        also self-deprecating. We were doing stories on those early Model S’s is having all kinds of quality problems.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">And he was going, <em>Yeah, we’re working on\r\n            it, but we’re doing this Herculean effort to get it up and running</em>. And, you know, I still think the\r\n        Model S—the original one—is the most important car of the 21st century, because that was what proved the case of\r\n        electric vehicles for the whole world. Because they were golf carts before that. They were, you know, the Nissan\r\n        Leaf Codas, things like that. And it became this It Car in Hollywood. You probably remember this. Everybody—all\r\n        the celebrities were trading in their Prius for the Model S. And it was fast, and it was sexy. I mean, it could\r\n        smoke a Porsche 911 in a drag race. Like, a Prius couldn’t do that.</p><gpt-ad\r\n        class=\"GptAd_root__pAvcS ArticleInjector_root__I7x9v s-native s-native--standard s-native--streamline\"\r\n        format=\"injector\" sizes-at-0=\"mobile-wide,native,house\" targeting-pos=\"csi-ad-6\"\r\n        sizes-at-976=\"desktop-wide,native,house\" id=\"gpt-unit-8\"></gpt-ad>\r\n    <div class=\"ArticleInjector_clsAvoider__dqIAm\"></div>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">And over time, we covered this guy and his\r\n        company. It’s like, <em>Hey! Here’s this quirky guy who’s kind of breaking all the rules, and he’s doing some\r\n            cool stuff, and he’s also clearly an asshole too. And he’s insane about some things. But what they’re coming\r\n            up with is this really interesting alternative to gas</em>. And I can just say personally, you know, by the\r\n        end of the last decade, I kind of realized that this is the future. This isn’t just a niche alternative to\r\n        gasoline. It’s the future.</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">And that wouldn’t have happened without\r\n        Tesla. But there are so many shades along the way of what happened with him that kind of inform where we’re at\r\n        now, just the way that he treated the press, the way that he treated open access to his company, the way that he\r\n        treated his own public image, the sort of vindictiveness against his enemies.</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">He can be very vain, certainly. He’s very\r\n        obsessed with his own public image, you know, very vindictive—obviously, calling that cave diver the “pedo guy”\r\n        or getting in a huge amount of trouble for saying he had the funds to take Tesla private. He had this Kanye\r\n        West–like trajectory. It’s like, <em>This guy’s brilliant, but he’s also horrible</em>. And over time, the\r\n        horrible part of him sort of overtakes that. But, you know, this amount of wealth that he amassed came with this\r\n        tremendous amount of power. And I think he has gotten really into his own myth and own legend about exercising\r\n        that power in unprecedented ways.</p><gpt-ad\r\n        class=\"GptAd_root__pAvcS ArticleInjector_root__I7x9v s-native s-native--standard s-native--streamline\"\r\n        format=\"injector\" sizes-at-0=\"mobile-wide,native,house\" targeting-pos=\"csi-ad-7\"\r\n        sizes-at-976=\"desktop-wide,native,house\" id=\"gpt-unit-9\"></gpt-ad>\r\n    <div class=\"ArticleInjector_clsAvoider__dqIAm\"></div>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"><strong>Warzel:</strong> So I’ve always been\r\n        fascinated with the correlation between Tesla’s stock price and Musk as a persona. There’s an analyst at Moody’s\r\n        who said, quote, “I do think fundamentally that a significant fraction of Tesla’s value is due to the fact that\r\n        Elon can command this attention continuously,” which sort of suggested to me that Musk is almost like a human\r\n        meme stock.</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">So I’m kind of curious: How much do you think\r\n        Tesla’s value is just tied to this future projection of Elon Musk as this guy who’s going to, you know, either\r\n        have that Edison-esque ability to innovate beyond any constraints or just that, you know, he can kind of brute\r\n        force his way into making the future bend to his will?</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"><strong>George:</strong> I think that the\r\n        value of the company, the image of the company, is extremely driven by him and by his involvement in it. Another\r\n        analyst we talk to a lot who’s one of the most bullish of all Tesla bulls, Dan Ives at Wedbush, you know, he\r\n        says repeatedly, <em>Elon is the heart and lungs of the Tesla story</em>.</p><gpt-ad\r\n        class=\"GptAd_root__pAvcS ArticleInjector_root__I7x9v s-native s-native--standard s-native--streamline\"\r\n        format=\"injector\" sizes-at-0=\"mobile-wide,native,house\" targeting-pos=\"csi-ad-8\"\r\n        sizes-at-976=\"desktop-wide,native,house\" id=\"gpt-unit-10\"></gpt-ad>\r\n    <div class=\"ArticleInjector_clsAvoider__dqIAm\"></div>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">And he said that Elon is Tesla and Tesla is\r\n        Elon. The idea is that he has had so much success and he’s generated so much value for the company before that\r\n        surely he’ll do it again, and he’ll keep doing it, and he’s the key driver of that.</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">I’m not sure there is a company in modern\r\n        times that is so intrinsically linked to one person. Probably the closest analog was Apple and Steve Jobs. I\r\n        mean, this has also led to kind of lack of accountability with Musk, too, because I think that at any other\r\n        company, certainly any company in the auto industry that we would cover, if you’ve seen the value of the company\r\n        get so tanked this hard over a number of months, that person, that CEO would’ve been shown the door by now. But\r\n        there is this belief that Musk is uniquely the one person who will deliver the future. And that’s something he’s\r\n        built up himself. Certainly, that’s a myth he’s built up himself.</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">I go back to the early days of Tesla, right?\r\n        The really early days, like, in the 2000s, there was a <em>New York Times</em> article about Tesla Motors and\r\n        what they were doing. And Musk—before he was CEO, he was just, like, an angel investor and heavily involved in\r\n        the company—was furious because it didn’t mention him at all.</p><gpt-ad\r\n        class=\"GptAd_root__pAvcS ArticleInjector_root__I7x9v s-native s-native--standard s-native--streamline\"\r\n        format=\"injector\" sizes-at-0=\"mobile-wide,native,house\" targeting-pos=\"csi-ad-9\"\r\n        sizes-at-976=\"desktop-wide,native,house\" id=\"gpt-unit-11\"></gpt-ad>\r\n    <div class=\"ArticleInjector_clsAvoider__dqIAm\"></div>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">So he always wanted his image to be wrapped\r\n        up in that. Long before he owned Twitter, he was one of the central figures on Twitter and really used Twitter\r\n        to get around traditional media and get around press releases and events and things like that to reach that\r\n        audience directly and build up a following directly.</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">And you said the phrase <em>meme stock</em>\r\n        earlier. We hear that quite a bit now, and it’s like, okay, admitting that Musk is damaging the company or\r\n        wanting him out, that will collapse a lot of that value. So, like, there is an incentive to sort of keep this\r\n        vibe—I almost want to say <em>grift</em>—going, so it keeps, you know, printing money as it has before.</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"><strong>Warzel:</strong> I think this protest\r\n        movement is extremely fascinating. I was in the Bay Area recently, and I was blown away. The person I was\r\n        visiting used to own a Tesla, and they said—</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"><strong>George:</strong> Used to?</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"><strong>Warzel:</strong> Yeah. And, well,\r\n        this was a while back. But they said that the person they sold it to, a friend, had it keyed the other day.</p>\r\n    <gpt-ad class=\"GptAd_root__pAvcS ArticleInjector_root__I7x9v s-native s-native--standard s-native--streamline\"\r\n        format=\"injector\" sizes-at-0=\"mobile-wide,native,house\" targeting-pos=\"csi-ad-10\"\r\n        sizes-at-976=\"desktop-wide,native,house\" id=\"gpt-unit-12\"></gpt-ad>\r\n    <div class=\"ArticleInjector_clsAvoider__dqIAm\"></div>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Even just on a very small scale, if it’s not\r\n        a protest, there seems to be lots of acts of, like, casual vandalism and things like that. And then, as recently\r\n        as March, I think there was a protest at nearly every Tesla dealership in the United States. So the movement\r\n        seems to be somewhat durable. And yet I think the very initial parts of this protest we watched coincide with a\r\n        pretty substantial drop in the stock, so much so that you have Elon Musk and Donald Trump basically doing a\r\n        Tesla infomercial on the White House South Lawn, right?</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Teslas and EVs have always had a political\r\n        valence, but does Tesla have a clear idea of what its brand is now? Because I don’t know if it’s going to sort\r\n        of reclaim that green, progressive halo anytime in the near future.</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"><strong>George:</strong> I actually do think\r\n        that the backlash against Tesla is the biggest crisis it’s ever faced, bigger than when it was a tiny start-up\r\n        trying to get its first real car out in ’08, when the world was crashing—bigger than when COVID happened, and it\r\n        had to shut down its factories. I think this is the biggest crisis it has ever faced as a company. And you said\r\n        at the beginning of our chat, Charlie, the word <em>polarizing</em>, right? And Tesla’s interesting because it’s\r\n        always been a polarizing brand.</p><gpt-ad\r\n        class=\"GptAd_root__pAvcS ArticleInjector_root__I7x9v s-native s-native--standard s-native--streamline\"\r\n        format=\"injector\" sizes-at-0=\"mobile-wide,native,house\" targeting-pos=\"csi-ad-11\"\r\n        sizes-at-976=\"desktop-wide,native,house\" id=\"gpt-unit-13\"></gpt-ad>\r\n    <div class=\"ArticleInjector_clsAvoider__dqIAm\"></div>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Like, when it was embraced by liberals and\r\n        Californians and the Hollywood crowd, you know, like, the rest of America was like, <em>Hey, you have a Tesla.\r\n            You’re so smug. You know, you’re saving the world, huh?</em> And now it’s kind of flipped on its head,\r\n        right? Now you have all of these folks in California who are trying—and kind of everywhere, they’re trying—to\r\n        get rid of their Teslas, like Democratic-leaning, progressive-leaning, even center-leaning people who are done\r\n        with the brand because of Elon, because of DOGE.</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Meanwhile, you have Fox News defending him\r\n        left and right, saying that he’s an American hero who must be protected at all costs. And you know, Pam Bondi\r\n        saying she’s going to stick up for him. I mean, what a bizarre reversal this is. And at the same time, there is\r\n        no evidence we have seen that buyers in red states, more conservative-leaning folks, are going to be flocking\r\n        the Teslas en masse.</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Like, I don’t want to stereotype here, but\r\n        there are many, many studies and data points that we’ve reported on over the years that show that\r\n        conservative-leaning voters are more skeptical of electric vehicles than liberal-leaning folks are. And that’s a\r\n        climate-change thing. And it’s also just, like, how they’ve been trained to view EVs over the years, you know?\r\n    </p><gpt-ad class=\"GptAd_root__pAvcS ArticleInjector_root__I7x9v s-native s-native--standard s-native--streamline\"\r\n        format=\"injector\" sizes-at-0=\"mobile-wide,native,house\" targeting-pos=\"csi-ad-12\"\r\n        sizes-at-976=\"desktop-wide,native,house\" id=\"gpt-unit-14\"></gpt-ad>\r\n    <div class=\"ArticleInjector_clsAvoider__dqIAm\"></div>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">So it’s like, <em>Are you for EVs or not? You\r\n            want Elon to succeed, but you’re not going to buy his car</em>. You know, like, I have family in deep-red\r\n        Texas, and, you know, when we were down there recently, everyone was saying, <em>Elon’s the best. He’s great.\r\n            He’s, you know, cutting government waste</em>.</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">It’s like, <em>Okay, well, would you buy one\r\n            of his cars?</em> Absolutely not. No. It’s like, that is a problem—that is a problem with them being able to\r\n        sell cars. And my personal theory is: The ultimate test of this is going to be the new Model Y, which just came\r\n        out.</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">And, you know, for those of you who don’t\r\n        know, and I bet there’s a good amount of people listening to this who probably own a Model Y, this is the\r\n        best-selling EV in the world. By some metrics, that’s the best-selling car in the world. There’s a new one out.\r\n        It looks a little different. The specs are better. It has more range. They fixed the interior up. It’s nicer.\r\n        All things equal, this should be the best-selling car in the world again. This should pull a repeat.</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">And if this thing doesn’t sell, if it has\r\n        lousy—you know, it just went on sale now, so we’re not going to know in the first quarter, but if a Q2, Q3, Q4\r\n        rolls around and this thing is sitting on dealer lots unsold, that is an existential problem for Tesla. That’s a\r\n        disaster moment for them. I think that would be the ultimate proof that they have totally alienated any\r\n        potential buyers or fans that they might have once had.</p><gpt-ad\r\n        class=\"GptAd_root__pAvcS ArticleInjector_root__I7x9v s-native s-native--standard s-native--streamline\"\r\n        format=\"injector\" sizes-at-0=\"mobile-wide,native,house\" targeting-pos=\"csi-ad-13\"\r\n        sizes-at-976=\"desktop-wide,native,house\" id=\"gpt-unit-15\"></gpt-ad>\r\n    <div class=\"ArticleInjector_clsAvoider__dqIAm\"></div>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"><strong>Warzel:</strong> But at the same\r\n        time, we just talked in this conversation about Musk’s, you know, ability to buoy the company and the stock. Do\r\n        you think that is under threat, essentially?</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"><strong>George:</strong> Yeah. And that’s\r\n        where the disconnect is, right? Is because the stock price at Tesla is all predicated on future stuff. It’s\r\n        solving autonomous driving. It’s robotaxis. It’s artificial intelligence, which Musk has gotten really into in\r\n        recent years. It’s predicated on robots too. Like, they see the future as automation. It’s not car sales. It’s\r\n        not duking it out with Nissan and Volkswagen over market share. Like, he doesn’t think that’s going to propel\r\n        the company to its, you know, trillion-dollar value and take him to the stars and help him start his Mars colony\r\n        someday if he’s just, you know, selling cars.</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">When we’re talking about why its value is so\r\n        high, it’s not just because Elon is great. It’s because for the last decade, Elon Musk has been personally\r\n        promising that self-driving cars, autonomous vehicles, robotaxis are, you know, about a year away—something he’s\r\n        been saying since 2016, about.</p><gpt-ad\r\n        class=\"GptAd_root__pAvcS ArticleInjector_root__I7x9v s-native s-native--standard s-native--streamline\"\r\n        format=\"injector\" sizes-at-0=\"mobile-wide,native,house\" targeting-pos=\"csi-ad-14\"\r\n        sizes-at-976=\"desktop-wide,native,house\" id=\"gpt-unit-16\"></gpt-ad>\r\n    <div class=\"ArticleInjector_clsAvoider__dqIAm\"></div>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">You know, that is the value of the company.\r\n        That’s where all that money is wrapped up. It’s the idea that this company specifically will solve self-driving\r\n        cars. Never mind the fact that, you know, Google’s Waymo has years more experience—you know, many, many, many\r\n        miles more experience.</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"><strong>Warzel:</strong> Yeah, they’re on the\r\n        roads.</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"><strong>George:</strong> They’re on the\r\n        roads. Yeah. You could go to—what?—half a dozen cities in America and use a Waymo. So they’re years ahead of\r\n        Tesla at actually getting a quote-unquote “robotaxi” service on the road. But there’s still that belief, with\r\n        all they’ve invested, that they’ll be the ones to deliver autonomous cars one day.</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">That’s the “valuation of Tesla” part of it.\r\n        But it’s still a car company. Its revenue still comes from being a car company. Its revenue still comes from\r\n        other car companies buying regulatory credits—meaning, you know, they pollute so much so they buy credits from\r\n        Tesla to offset their polluting. That’s a huge source of their revenue.</p><gpt-ad\r\n        class=\"GptAd_root__pAvcS ArticleInjector_root__I7x9v s-native s-native--standard s-native--streamline\"\r\n        format=\"injector\" sizes-at-0=\"mobile-wide,native,house\" targeting-pos=\"csi-ad-15\"\r\n        sizes-at-976=\"desktop-wide,native,house\" id=\"gpt-unit-17\"></gpt-ad>\r\n    <div class=\"ArticleInjector_clsAvoider__dqIAm\"></div>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">So he may have these grand dreams of robots\r\n        and space and AI and everything else, but right now, it does need to sell cars. It does need to move metal. And\r\n        if it can’t do that and the revenue tanks, you know, you can forget AI and robotaxis.</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">And the other thing I think about, too, is\r\n        supposedly they’re going to be launching their robotaxi service in Austin this summer. Okay. Right. Well, if\r\n        he’s made this brand so caustic and so controversial, who’s going to want to use that service? I mean, is it\r\n        really going to be some widespread thing like Uber, or are people going to go out of their way to avoid it? And\r\n        I think that latter outcome is a very real possibility here.</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"><strong>[<em>Music</em>]</strong></p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"><strong>Warzel:</strong> When we’re back, I\r\n        ask Patrick George to explain why Tesla’s crisis may be existential for reasons beyond Elon Musk.</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"><strong>[<em>Break</em>]</strong></p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"><strong>Warzel:</strong> So putting aside\r\n        Musk just a moment here: The protests we’ve mentioned have been noticeable. I’m curious: What are the\r\n        non-Musk-related threats to Tesla, right? We have Tesla having this real, genuine, first-mover advantage,\r\n        especially in the United States.</p><gpt-ad\r\n        class=\"GptAd_root__pAvcS ArticleInjector_root__I7x9v s-native s-native--standard s-native--streamline\"\r\n        format=\"injector\" sizes-at-0=\"mobile-wide,native,house\" targeting-pos=\"csi-ad-16\"\r\n        sizes-at-976=\"desktop-wide,native,house\" id=\"gpt-unit-18\"></gpt-ad>\r\n    <div class=\"ArticleInjector_clsAvoider__dqIAm\"></div>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">But it’s not alone anymore. You’ve got\r\n        Rivian. You’ve got Polestar. You’ve got, you know, a series of EV competitors. Taking the Musk and Trump out of\r\n        it, what does the company have to worry about right now?</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"><strong>George:</strong> Yeah, let’s start\r\n        with competition, right? Because it’s not just the start-ups you mentioned. It’s that Tesla sparked this\r\n        industry-wide shift towards electrification. And when we say <em>electrification</em>, that means more hybrids\r\n        and eventually a move to an all-EV market. And this started in kind of the middle-end of the last decade, when\r\n        all of these traditional automakers started chasing Tesla’s value.</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Like, when you’re Ford or you’re Toyota,\r\n        you’re looking at Tesla like, <em>Why the hell are they valued so much more than we are? Like, we need to be\r\n            like Tesla. We need to become tech companies. We need to electrify</em>. And it took them years to do it.\r\n        And, I mean, let’s be honest. Like, not all of them are pulling this off, this transformation from being\r\n        traditional carmakers to being, you know, makers of software and battery-powered vehicles.</p><br>\r\n    <div class=\"ArticleInjector_clsAvoider__dqIAm\"></div>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Like, this is all we write about at\r\n        InsideEVs. It’s just the struggles to do that. But they’re getting there. And some of them are now surpassing\r\n        Tesla in many ways. Like, you can buy a Hyundai or a Kia with more range than a Tesla has, and faster charging.\r\n        There’s stuff Volvo’s coming out with that has, you know, 400-plus miles of range. There’s better performance\r\n        from cars like Audi now that are electric also.</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">So Tesla started this, but they haven’t been\r\n        able to keep up, and that’s been a huge criticism of this company for a long time, is they haven’t kept their\r\n        product lineup fresh, as every company should. Like, there was the Cybertruck and then one update to the Model 3\r\n        sedan. Beyond that, there hasn’t really been a lot. And meanwhile, you have other companies coming out with,\r\n        like, three-row SUVs and more crossovers and just more different options in the EV space. And that’s just in the\r\n        West.</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">The other problem is that once they set up\r\n        shop in China, which Tesla’s Shanghai factory is what has provided them with stable long-term profits since the\r\n        early part of this decade. But it also got the entire Chinese auto industry—took that baton and ran with it.\r\n        And, I mean, you know, we see all the time—like, you probably heard the news last few weeks: The Chinese\r\n        automaker BYD has a new technology for five-minute EV fast charging. Like, nothing in America comes close to\r\n        that, and we probably won’t for a decade or more.</p>\r\n       <br>\r\n    <div class=\"ArticleInjector_clsAvoider__dqIAm\"></div>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">So with its incredible industrial might,\r\n        like, China is racing way ahead of Tesla, and Tesla’s kind of a stale brand there. So between the protests in\r\n        America and Europe that are tanking sales, and the fact that Chinese buyers are moving on to other brands, like,\r\n        I think the picture doesn’t look great for this company.</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"><strong>Warzel:</strong> A big thing that I\r\n        have seen as sort of an EV dilettante is the notion of, you know, especially in America, Tesla’s charging\r\n        network, and that infrastructural portion being really important to the company.</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">The idea of the BYD extremely fast chargers,\r\n        like, are those, in your mind, existential threats to Tesla?</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"><strong>George:</strong> Not any one thing,\r\n        but put it all together, and yes. And remember what we said about how so much of Tesla’s value is locked up in\r\n        solving autonomous cars? Well, BYD also has—they call it God’s Eye, an autonomous-driving system that they’re\r\n        putting on, like, Toyota Corolla–priced vehicles in China.</p>\r\n        <br>\r\n    <div class=\"ArticleInjector_clsAvoider__dqIAm\"></div>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">So, like, I can’t attest this myself. It’s\r\n        obviously hard for us to test Chinese cars as extensively as we would here. But, like, this company claims to\r\n        have done something Tesla’s promised for a long time, but a hell of a lot cheaper.</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Then you have faster charging. Then you have\r\n        the fact that, you know, China’s full of—what?—two dozen Tesla-esque companies that are racing ahead. All these\r\n        little things adding up, like, it’s like a dam bursting almost—that just all these things that this company\r\n        pioneered, it can’t keep up with at scale.</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Tariffs and geopolitical tensions keep BYD\r\n        and the other Chinese car companies out of our market for now. I personally tend to think that’s a temporary\r\n        thing, at best, and that capitalism, even China’s version of it, tends to find a way.</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">But, you know, once that happens and one of\r\n        these automakers is able to sell in this country or even build cars in Ohio or Michigan or Tennessee or\r\n        whatever, and you know, the Americans can get a taste of something that far surpasses a Tesla for much cheaper,\r\n        I think that’s going to be a real headache for that company.</p>\r\n       <br>\r\n    <div class=\"ArticleInjector_clsAvoider__dqIAm\"></div>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"><strong>Warzel:</strong> Well, and as you’re\r\n        saying all this, what’s running through my mind is this, like, complex threat matrix. You know, like, everyone’s\r\n        sort of encircling Tesla in this way. And meanwhile, Elon Musk—who I said I was going to keep out of it for a\r\n        second, but I have to bring him back in— it seems from the outside, was not paying any attention to any of this.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"><strong>George:</strong> Certainly busy, but\r\n        he’s also remarkably tactical. I don’t believe, based on everything I’ve heard and read and interviewed, and\r\n        associates I’ve talked to about the guy—like, he does think many moves ahead. And I think part of the reason\r\n        that Tesla’s stock price shot up after the election was this belief that by working with Trump, Elon can sort of\r\n        carve out a regulatory framework, get rid of regulations in America that limit the deployment of autonomous\r\n        cars—like, essentially that by working with Trump, they could, you know, deploy autonomous cars and robotaxis\r\n        more quickly nationally and in a way that’s favorable to Tesla. Because right now, the regulations governing\r\n        autonomous cars are state by state. It’s municipality by municipality. It’s very patchwork.</p>\r\n        \r\n    <div class=\"ArticleInjector_clsAvoider__dqIAm\"></div>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">But if you had a federal framework, and if\r\n        that framework was favorable to Tesla, you know, that is a game changer for their ability to deliver on the\r\n        promise of their stock price. Like, that’s where my mind goes for the car company, specifically. And when Trump\r\n        was still on the campaign trail right before the election, Elon said as much. He was basically up there being\r\n        like, <em>Yeah, we need a regulatory framework that’s going to work for autonomous cars</em>.</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">That’s all boring to say. But the idea is\r\n        that when you watch Fox News and their defense of this great American business patriot, it’s just that he’s just\r\n        a hero who is cutting government waste and getting rid of the deficit, when, in reality, I think that he used\r\n        this to enrich his own companies and to clear out obstacles for the things he wants to do, especially when\r\n        Tesla’s concerned for robotaxis.</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">But that single-minded focus on autonomy and\r\n        AI has meant they’ve taken their eye off the ball when it comes to products, when it comes to cars people can\r\n        buy. And he’s been on record as saying that it’s pointless for us to come out with another car that has a\r\n        steering wheel. Like, why would you do that? It’s like coming out with, like, a horse and buggy, but the\r\n        technology’s not there yet. You know, for now at least, it does have to be a car company, and it does have to\r\n        still do battle with Hyundai and General Motors and BYD, whether he wants it to or not.</p>\r\n       <br>\r\n    <div class=\"ArticleInjector_clsAvoider__dqIAm\"></div>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"><strong>Warzel:</strong> It sounds like a\r\n        very classic sort of—you know, as someone who’s followed Musk for a really long time—his obsession with the\r\n        future, and I think genuine. Like, actual, genuine enthusiasm for the possibility of things. His sci-fi brain is\r\n        so overactive that it causes this. Like, I’m sure that there’s an element of bullshitting here with, like,\r\n        <em>We’re going to be in Mars by 2030, and everyone’s going to be walking around</em>.</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"><strong>George:</strong> Been saying this\r\n        stuff for 10-years-plus. Yeah.</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"><strong>Warzel:</strong> But I think there is\r\n        also a genuineness, too, right? Like, the steering-wheel thing feels very real to me, right? Like, <em>This is\r\n            right around the corner. Of course, we’re not going to build another car with the steering wheel.</em></p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Meanwhile, every year that future pushes\r\n        further and further away is another year that Tesla doesn’t have that product that can sort of fill the gap\r\n        between his understanding of what is to come and the reality that, like, we’re just not there yet.</p>\r\n        <br>\r\n    <div class=\"ArticleInjector_clsAvoider__dqIAm\"></div>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"><strong>George:</strong> Yeah. But this\r\n        speaks to how they’ve been successful before. And it’s just—that’s the Musk mentality. You just kick down every\r\n        door until you get what you want. And I go back to when they built the Model 3, you know, the first really\r\n        affordable sedan. It’s not just that it’s a cheap electric car.</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">It’s built in a completely different way than\r\n        cars were built before. And the factory that builds it had to be completely reset from how car factories worked.\r\n        It’s like, <em>Just hit reset on everything, and just do it</em>. That’s your goal. And you just do it. But they\r\n        are running into technological limitations with how they do autonomous driving.</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Like, they are not there yet. And, like, I’ve\r\n        used autopilot. I’ve used full self-driving for many years. I have seen it get better.</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"><strong>Warzel:</strong> Those are Tesla\r\n        features.</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"><strong>George:</strong> Yeah, of course.\r\n        Right. These are the self-driving Tesla features. I should say, they’re not really self-driving. This is what we\r\n        would call a semi-autonomous driving-assistance system that kind of helps you on the highway or will take over\r\n        some steering around town if we’re talking about full self-driving, and they’re getting better.</p>\r\n        <br>\r\n    <div class=\"ArticleInjector_clsAvoider__dqIAm\"></div>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Full self-driving tried to kill me on two\r\n        separate occasions, Charlie, which really hurt my feelings. And it hasn’t done that in a while, but it’s still\r\n        not a hundred percent. And for true autonomous driving to work, it has to be safer and better than a human every\r\n        single time, in every single scenario.</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">And they’re not there yet.</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"><strong>Warzel:</strong> What is so difficult\r\n        to put together for someone like myself—but I assume, also, a lot of different people who aren’t paying\r\n        attention to Musk and Tesla, like, this granularly—we’re talking about an inability to fill the gap between the\r\n        technological future of Musk’s imagination and the current moment, right? Do you think some of that is just,\r\n        like, the margins of starting to, you know, suffer these consequences for not delivering?</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"><strong>George:</strong> You know, a year\r\n        ago, I kind of thought if Elon ever met his Waterloo, it would be his inability to deliver on these promises of\r\n        autonomy and autonomous cars. Like, it would just get to the point where that technology’s just not there yet.\r\n        You know? And maybe someday it will. I think on a long enough timeline, yeah—probably humans will not be driving\r\n        cars.</p>\r\n        <br>\r\n    <div class=\"ArticleInjector_clsAvoider__dqIAm\"></div>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Maybe that’s 10 years from now or 100 years\r\n        from now. I don’t know. But lately, I think that what may be his greatest downfall and what may be a kind of\r\n        death blow to this company is his inability to understand people. He understands technology, but he doesn’t get\r\n        people. And he has said, you know, empathy is a weakness.</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">He doesn’t relate to other people well. You\r\n        know, he’s blamed this on being neurodivergent, I guess. Either way, not a great people person. And I don’t\r\n        think he counted on people abandoning the Tesla brand as furiously as they are, as quickly as they are, in\r\n        response to him, in response to his actions with DOGE.</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">I don’t think he counted on that.

One of them carried out Donald Trump’s ruthless cost-cutting mission while the other pitched cars that appealed most to people who were highly likely to oppose that mission, or even rage against it. As activists spray-painted STOP DOGE on Teslas at dealerships and anti-Tesla protests spread all over the world, there still was no concrete proof that Elon Musk had to amend either version of himself. Then this week came Tesla’s first quarterly earnings report since Musk started his work with DOGE, showing the company’s profits down 71 percent from the same time last year. After a conference call, one major investor said Musk was “delusional.” Suddenly it seemed as if Musk was on a “Kanye West–like trajectory,” according to Patrick George, editor in chief of InsideEVs and our guest this week on Radio Atlantic.\r\n\r\nGeorge has been covering Tesla since the 2010s. He’s watched Musk shoot himself in the foot in the lead-up to this moment, so he is well placed to understand why Musk didn’t see this coming. In this week’s episode, the Atlantic staff writer Charlie Warzel interviews George about how Musk found himself in this predicament.\r\n\r\nThe following is a transcript of the episode:\r\n\r\nNews clip: Growing backlash against Elon Musk and his new role in President Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency, also known as DOGE— News clip: Protestors taking out their anger on the Tesla car and owners were busy all over the country— News clip: Tesla, the car company Musk founded and runs, has seen its stock price fall dramatically, as you can see from this chart—\r\n\r\nHanna Rosin: The moment of reckoning for Tesla’s founder has arrived. The company’s earnings report showed that profits dropped 71 percent since this time last year. On a call with investors this week, Musk announced that he would spend a day or two per week on his Washington business but that he would mostly turn his attention back to the struggling company.\r\n\r\nAs Patrick George, the editor in chief of InsideEVs, wrote in The Atlantic this week: Luck runs out.\r\n\r\nPatrick George: I think he thought he would come in and gut the federal government and be seen as this great crusader and that everything would’ve worked out great just the way it always has. He’s had all this success before, right? But now, like, people are, you know—they’re running away from this company, and that might be the greatest failure of all here.\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nRosin: I’m Hanna Rosin, and this is Radio Atlantic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy colleague Charlie Warzel interviewed Patrick George recently about the tumultuous journey Tesla’s been on, from darling of the environmentally conscious to target of tire slashing. And the two of them land on Musk’s blind spot, which caused him to miss this coming crash.\r\n\r\nCharlie Warzel: Patrick George, welcome to Radio Atlantic. Thank you for joining me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge: Great to be here, Charlie. Thanks for having me.\r\n\r\nRosin: Their conversation explains so well how we got to this moment.\r\n\r\nGeorge: Covering Tesla in the 2010s, the kind of hate mail we would get from people whenever we’d criticize the company or put something negative in one of the reviews of the Tesla, whatever—there were so many people back then who were such true believers in what he was doing, I mean, thinking that he’s saving the world. And I’m kind of sad for those folks now who really believed in this environmental mission of the company. Those are the ones who are dumping their Teslas. Those are the ones who feel abandoned right now, who feel betrayed by this guy they once believed in who has very much gone to what they perceive as the dark side.\r\n\r\nWarzel: What has been going through your head over the last few months as we’re watching, you know, Musk take this role in the government and have this interplay between his polarization and the stock?\r\n\r\nGeorge: You know, every now and then, I have to step back when I read a sentence in the news or I even write a sentence on InsideEVs or for The Atlantic—you know, something like, President Trump holds a White House “summit” full of Teslas, you know, amid widespread protests against Elon Musk, his chief advisor and government cost cutter, that are happening all over the world, including vandalism.\r\n\r\nAnd I just stepped back, and I’m like, How did we get here? Like, is someone putting LSD in my coffee every morning? Like, this is just such a baffling, bizarre outcome from the way that Tesla’s trajectory has worked for the longest time and where it’s at now. You know, for lack of a better term, it’s kind of insane, honestly.\r\n\r\nWhen I started covering Tesla, and I was a young writer at Jalopnik—I started at the end of 2012. And one of the first things I did was my then–editor in chief, Matt Hardigree, and I—we interviewed Elon Musk from the Tesla factory floor when they were trying to get the Model S up and running.\r\n\r\nYou know, the first car was the Roadster. And that was kind of a science project, honestly. It was a Lotus Elise stuffed with laptop batteries, more or less. And the Model S was their first real car. And they were trying to get it ramped up. And we talked to him, on the factory floor. And I remember, you know, him being at the time very tired but, you know, charming, smart, but also self-deprecating. We were doing stories on those early Model S’s is having all kinds of quality problems.\r\n\r\nAnd he was going, Yeah, we’re working on it, but we’re doing this Herculean effort to get it up and running. And, you know, I still think the Model S—the original one—is the most important car of the 21st century, because that was what proved the case of electric vehicles for the whole world. Because they were golf carts before that. They were, you know, the Nissan Leaf Codas, things like that. And it became this It Car in Hollywood. You probably remember this. Everybody—all the celebrities were trading in their Prius for the Model S. And it was fast, and it was sexy. I mean, it could smoke a Porsche 911 in a drag race. Like, a Prius couldn’t do that.\r\n\r\nAnd over time, we covered this guy and his company. It’s like, Hey! Here’s this quirky guy who’s kind of breaking all the rules, and he’s doing some cool stuff, and he’s also clearly an asshole too. And he’s insane about some things. But what they’re coming up with is this really interesting alternative to gas. And I can just say personally, you know, by the end of the last decade, I kind of realized that this is the future. This isn’t just a niche alternative to gasoline. It’s the future.\r\n\r\nAnd that wouldn’t have happened without Tesla. But there are so many shades along the way of what happened with him that kind of inform where we’re at now, just the way that he treated the press, the way that he treated open access to his company, the way that he treated his own public image, the sort of vindictiveness against his enemies.\r\n\r\nHe can be very vain, certainly. He’s very obsessed with his own public image, you know, very vindictive—obviously, calling that cave diver the “pedo guy” or getting in a huge amount of trouble for saying he had the funds to take Tesla private. He had this Kanye West–like trajectory. It’s like, This guy’s brilliant, but he’s also horrible. And over time, the horrible part of him sort of overtakes that. But, you know, this amount of wealth that he amassed came with this tremendous amount of power. And I think he has gotten really into his own myth and own legend about exercising that power in unprecedented ways.\r\n\r\nWarzel: So I’ve always been fascinated with the correlation between Tesla’s stock price and Musk as a persona. There’s an analyst at Moody’s who said, quote, “I do think fundamentally that a significant fraction of Tesla’s value is due to the fact that Elon can command this attention continuously,” which sort of suggested to me that Musk is almost like a human meme stock.\r\n\r\nSo I’m kind of curious: How much do you think Tesla’s value is just tied to this future projection of Elon Musk as this guy who’s going to, you know, either have that Edison-esque ability to innovate beyond any constraints or just that, you know, he can kind of brute force his way into making the future bend to his will?\r\n\r\nGeorge: I think that the value of the company, the image of the company, is extremely driven by him and by his involvement in it. Another analyst we talk to a lot who’s one of the most bullish of all Tesla bulls, Dan Ives at Wedbush, you know, he says repeatedly, Elon is the heart and lungs of the Tesla story.\r\n\r\nAnd he said that Elon is Tesla and Tesla is Elon. The idea is that he has had so much success and he’s generated so much value for the company before that surely he’ll do it again, and he’ll keep doing it, and he’s the key driver of that.\r\n\r\nI’m not sure there is a company in modern times that is so intrinsically linked to one person. Probably the closest analog was Apple and Steve Jobs. I mean, this has also led to kind of lack of accountability with Musk, too, because I think that at any other company, certainly any company in the auto industry that we would cover, if you’ve seen the value of the company get so tanked this hard over a number of months, that person, that CEO would’ve been shown the door by now. But there is this belief that Musk is uniquely the one person who will deliver the future. And that’s something he’s built up himself. Certainly, that’s a myth he’s built up himself.\r\n\r\nI go back to the early days of Tesla, right? The really early days, like, in the 2000s, there was a New York Times article about Tesla Motors and what they were doing. And Musk—before he was CEO, he was just, like, an angel investor and heavily involved in the company—was furious because it didn’t mention him at all.\r\n\r\nSo he always wanted his image to be wrapped up in that. Long before he owned Twitter, he was one of the central figures on Twitter and really used Twitter to get around traditional media and get around press releases and events and things like that to reach that audience directly and build up a following directly.\r\n\r\nAnd you said the phrase meme stock earlier. We hear that quite a bit now, and it’s like, okay, admitting that Musk is damaging the company or wanting him out, that will collapse a lot of that value. So, like, there is an incentive to sort of keep this vibe—I almost want to say grift—going, so it keeps, you know, printing money as it has before.\r\n\r\nWarzel: I think this protest movement is extremely fascinating. I was in the Bay Area recently, and I was blown away. The person I was visiting used to own a Tesla, and they said—\r\n\r\nGeorge: Used to?\r\n\r\nWarzel: Yeah. And, well, this was a while back. But they said that the person they sold it to, a friend, had it keyed the other day.\r\n\r\nEven just on a very small scale, if it’s not a protest, there seems to be lots of acts of, like, casual vandalism and things like that. And then, as recently as March, I think there was a protest at nearly every Tesla dealership in the United States. So the movement seems to be somewhat durable. And yet I think the very initial parts of this protest we watched coincide with a pretty substantial drop in the stock, so much so that you have Elon Musk and Donald Trump basically doing a Tesla infomercial on the White House South Lawn, right?\r\n\r\nTeslas and EVs have always had a political valence, but does Tesla have a clear idea of what its brand is now? Because I don’t know if it’s going to sort of reclaim that green, progressive halo anytime in the near future.\r\n\r\nGeorge: I actually do think that the backlash against Tesla is the biggest crisis it’s ever faced, bigger than when it was a tiny start-up trying to get its first real car out in ’08, when the world was crashing—bigger than when COVID happened, and it had to shut down its factories. I think this is the biggest crisis it has ever faced as a company. And you said at the beginning of our chat, Charlie, the word polarizing, right? And Tesla’s interesting because it’s always been a polarizing brand.\r\n\r\nLike, when it was embraced by liberals and Californians and the Hollywood crowd, you know, like, the rest of America was like, Hey, you have a Tesla. You’re so smug. You know, you’re saving the world, huh? And now it’s kind of flipped on its head, right? Now you have all of these folks in California who are trying—and kind of everywhere, they’re trying—to get rid of their Teslas, like Democratic-leaning, progressive-leaning, even center-leaning people who are done with the brand because of Elon, because of DOGE.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, you have Fox News defending him left and right, saying that he’s an American hero who must be protected at all costs. And you know, Pam Bondi saying she’s going to stick up for him. I mean, what a bizarre reversal this is. And at the same time, there is no evidence we have seen that buyers in red states, more conservative-leaning folks, are going to be flocking the Teslas en masse.\r\n\r\nLike, I don’t want to stereotype here, but there are many, many studies and data points that we’ve reported on over the years that show that conservative-leaning voters are more skeptical of electric vehicles than liberal-leaning folks are. And that’s a climate-change thing. And it’s also just, like, how they’ve been trained to view EVs over the years, you know?\r\n\r\nSo it’s like, Are you for EVs or not? You want Elon to succeed, but you’re not going to buy his car. You know, like, I have family in deep-red Texas, and, you know, when we were down there recently, everyone was saying, Elon’s the best. He’s great. He’s, you know, cutting government waste.\r\n\r\nIt’s like, Okay, well, would you buy one of his cars? Absolutely not. No. It’s like, that is a problem—that is a problem with them being able to sell cars. And my personal theory is: The ultimate test of this is going to be the new Model Y, which just came out.\r\n\r\nAnd, you know, for those of you who don’t know, and I bet there’s a good amount of people listening to this who probably own a Model Y, this is the best-selling EV in the world. By some metrics, that’s the best-selling car in the world. There’s a new one out. It looks a little different. The specs are better. It has more range. They fixed the interior up. It’s nicer. All things equal, this should be the best-selling car in the world again. This should pull a repeat.\r\n\r\nAnd if this thing doesn’t sell, if it has lousy—you know, it just went on sale now, so we’re not going to know in the first quarter, but if a Q2, Q3, Q4 rolls around and this thing is sitting on dealer lots unsold, that is an existential problem for Tesla. That’s a disaster moment for them. I think that would be the ultimate proof that they have totally alienated any potential buyers or fans that they might have once had.\r\n\r\nWarzel: But at the same time, we just talked in this conversation about Musk’s, you know, ability to buoy the company and the stock. Do you think that is under threat, essentially?\r\n\r\nGeorge: Yeah. And that’s where the disconnect is, right? Is because the stock price at Tesla is all predicated on future stuff. It’s solving autonomous driving. It’s robotaxis. It’s artificial intelligence, which Musk has gotten really into in recent years. It’s predicated on robots too. Like, they see the future as automation. It’s not car sales. It’s not duking it out with Nissan and Volkswagen over market share. Like, he doesn’t think that’s going to propel the company to its, you know, trillion-dollar value and take him to the stars and help him start his Mars colony someday if he’s just, you know, selling cars.\r\n\r\nWhen we’re talking about why its value is so high, it’s not just because Elon is great. It’s because for the last decade, Elon Musk has been personally promising that self-driving cars, autonomous vehicles, robotaxis are, you know, about a year away—something he’s been saying since 2016, about.\r\n\r\nYou know, that is the value of the company. That’s where all that money is wrapped up. It’s the idea that this company specifically will solve self-driving cars. Never mind the fact that, you know, Google’s Waymo has years more experience—you know, many, many, many miles more experience.\r\n\r\nWarzel: Yeah, they’re on the roads.\r\n\r\nGeorge: They’re on the roads. Yeah. You could go to—what?—half a dozen cities in America and use a Waymo. So they’re years ahead of Tesla at actually getting a quote-unquote “robotaxi” service on the road. But there’s still that belief, with all they’ve invested, that they’ll be the ones to deliver autonomous cars one day.\r\n\r\nThat’s the “valuation of Tesla” part of it. But it’s still a car company. Its revenue still comes from being a car company. Its revenue still comes from other car companies buying regulatory credits—meaning, you know, they pollute so much so they buy credits from Tesla to offset their polluting. That’s a huge source of their revenue.\r\n\r\nSo he may have these grand dreams of robots and space and AI and everything else, but right now, it does need to sell cars. It does need to move metal. And if it can’t do that and the revenue tanks, you know, you can forget AI and robotaxis.\r\n\r\nAnd the other thing I think about, too, is supposedly they’re going to be launching their robotaxi service in Austin this summer. Okay. Right. Well, if he’s made this brand so caustic and so controversial, who’s going to want to use that service? I mean, is it really going to be some widespread thing like Uber, or are people going to go out of their way to avoid it? And I think that latter outcome is a very real possibility here.\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nWarzel: When we’re back, I ask Patrick George to explain why Tesla’s crisis may be existential for reasons beyond Elon Musk.\r\n\r\n[Break]\r\n\r\nWarzel: So putting aside Musk just a moment here: The protests we’ve mentioned have been noticeable. I’m curious: What are the non-Musk-related threats to Tesla, right? We have Tesla having this real, genuine, first-mover advantage, especially in the United States.\r\n\r\nBut it’s not alone anymore. You’ve got Rivian. You’ve got Polestar. You’ve got, you know, a series of EV competitors. Taking the Musk and Trump out of it, what does the company have to worry about right now?\r\n\r\nGeorge: Yeah, let’s start with competition, right? Because it’s not just the start-ups you mentioned. It’s that Tesla sparked this industry-wide shift towards electrification. And when we say electrification, that means more hybrids and eventually a move to an all-EV market. And this started in kind of the middle-end of the last decade, when all of these traditional automakers started chasing Tesla’s value.\r\n\r\nLike, when you’re Ford or you’re Toyota, you’re looking at Tesla like, Why the hell are they valued so much more than we are? Like, we need to be like Tesla. We need to become tech companies. We need to electrify. And it took them years to do it. And, I mean, let’s be honest. Like, not all of them are pulling this off, this transformation from being traditional carmakers to being, you know, makers of software and battery-powered vehicles.\r\n\r\nLike, this is all we write about at InsideEVs. It’s just the struggles to do that. But they’re getting there. And some of them are now surpassing Tesla in many ways. Like, you can buy a Hyundai or a Kia with more range than a Tesla has, and faster charging. There’s stuff Volvo’s coming out with that has, you know, 400-plus miles of range. There’s better performance from cars like Audi now that are electric also.\r\n\r\nSo Tesla started this, but they haven’t been able to keep up, and that’s been a huge criticism of this company for a long time, is they haven’t kept their product lineup fresh, as every company should. Like, there was the Cybertruck and then one update to the Model 3 sedan. Beyond that, there hasn’t really been a lot. And meanwhile, you have other companies coming out with, like, three-row SUVs and more crossovers and just more different options in the EV space. And that’s just in the West.\r\n\r\nThe other problem is that once they set up shop in China, which Tesla’s Shanghai factory is what has provided them with stable long-term profits since the early part of this decade. But it also got the entire Chinese auto industry—took that baton and ran with it. And, I mean, you know, we see all the time—like, you probably heard the news last few weeks: The Chinese automaker BYD has a new technology for five-minute EV fast charging. Like, nothing in America comes close to that, and we probably won’t for a decade or more.\r\n\r\nSo with its incredible industrial might, like, China is racing way ahead of Tesla, and Tesla’s kind of a stale brand there. So between the protests in America and Europe that are tanking sales, and the fact that Chinese buyers are moving on to other brands, like, I think the picture doesn’t look great for this company.\r\n\r\nWarzel: A big thing that I have seen as sort of an EV dilettante is the notion of, you know, especially in America, Tesla’s charging network, and that infrastructural portion being really important to the company.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the BYD extremely fast chargers, like, are those, in your mind, existential threats to Tesla?\r\n\r\nGeorge: Not any one thing, but put it all together, and yes. And remember what we said about how so much of Tesla’s value is locked up in solving autonomous cars? Well, BYD also has—they call it God’s Eye, an autonomous-driving system that they’re putting on, like, Toyota Corolla–priced vehicles in China.\r\n\r\nSo, like, I can’t attest this myself. It’s obviously hard for us to test Chinese cars as extensively as we would here. But, like, this company claims to have done something Tesla’s promised for a long time, but a hell of a lot cheaper.\r\n\r\nThen you have faster charging. Then you have the fact that, you know, China’s full of—what?—two dozen Tesla-esque companies that are racing ahead. All these little things adding up, like, it’s like a dam bursting almost—that just all these things that this company pioneered, it can’t keep up with at scale.\r\n\r\nTariffs and geopolitical tensions keep BYD and the other Chinese car companies out of our market for now. I personally tend to think that’s a temporary thing, at best, and that capitalism, even China’s version of it, tends to find a way.\r\n\r\nBut, you know, once that happens and one of these automakers is able to sell in this country or even build cars in Ohio or Michigan or Tennessee or whatever, and you know, the Americans can get a taste of something that far surpasses a Tesla for much cheaper, I think that’s going to be a real headache for that company.\r\n\r\nWarzel: Well, and as you’re saying all this, what’s running through my mind is this, like, complex threat matrix. You know, like, everyone’s sort of encircling Tesla in this way. And meanwhile, Elon Musk—who I said I was going to keep out of it for a second, but I have to bring him back in— it seems from the outside, was not paying any attention to any of this.\r\n\r\nGeorge: Certainly busy, but he’s also remarkably tactical. I don’t believe, based on everything I’ve heard and read and interviewed, and associates I’ve talked to about the guy—like, he does think many moves ahead. And I think part of the reason that Tesla’s stock price shot up after the election was this belief that by working with Trump, Elon can sort of carve out a regulatory framework, get rid of regulations in America that limit the deployment of autonomous cars—like, essentially that by working with Trump, they could, you know, deploy autonomous cars and robotaxis more quickly nationally and in a way that’s favorable to Tesla. Because right now, the regulations governing autonomous cars are state by state. It’s municipality by municipality. It’s very patchwork.\r\n\r\nBut if you had a federal framework, and if that framework was favorable to Tesla, you know, that is a game changer for their ability to deliver on the promise of their stock price. Like, that’s where my mind goes for the car company, specifically. And when Trump was still on the campaign trail right before the election, Elon said as much. He was basically up there being like, Yeah, we need a regulatory framework that’s going to work for autonomous cars.\r\n\r\nThat’s all boring to say. But the idea is that when you watch Fox News and their defense of this great American business patriot, it’s just that he’s just a hero who is cutting government waste and getting rid of the deficit, when, in reality, I think that he used this to enrich his own companies and to clear out obstacles for the things he wants to do, especially when Tesla’s concerned for robotaxis.\r\n\r\nBut that single-minded focus on autonomy and AI has meant they’ve taken their eye off the ball when it comes to products, when it comes to cars people can buy. And he’s been on record as saying that it’s pointless for us to come out with another car that has a steering wheel. Like, why would you do that? It’s like coming out with, like, a horse and buggy, but the technology’s not there yet. You know, for now at least, it does have to be a car company, and it does have to still do battle with Hyundai and General Motors and BYD, whether he wants it to or not.\r\n\r\nWarzel: It sounds like a very classic sort of—you know, as someone who’s followed Musk for a really long time—his obsession with the future, and I think genuine. Like, actual, genuine enthusiasm for the possibility of things. His sci-fi brain is so overactive that it causes this. Like, I’m sure that there’s an element of bullshitting here with, like, We’re going to be in Mars by 2030, and everyone’s going to be walking around.\r\n\r\nGeorge: Been saying this stuff for 10-years-plus. Yeah.\r\n\r\nWarzel: But I think there is also a genuineness, too, right? Like, the steering-wheel thing feels very real to me, right? Like, This is right around the corner. Of course, we’re not going to build another car with the steering wheel.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, every year that future pushes further and further away is another year that Tesla doesn’t have that product that can sort of fill the gap between his understanding of what is to come and the reality that, like, we’re just not there yet.\r\n\r\nGeorge: Yeah. But this speaks to how they’ve been successful before. And it’s just—that’s the Musk mentality. You just kick down every door until you get what you want. And I go back to when they built the Model 3, you know, the first really affordable sedan. It’s not just that it’s a cheap electric car.\r\n\r\nIt’s built in a completely different way than cars were built before. And the factory that builds it had to be completely reset from how car factories worked. It’s like, Just hit reset on everything, and just do it. That’s your goal. And you just do it. But they are running into technological limitations with how they do autonomous driving.\r\n\r\nLike, they are not there yet. And, like, I’ve used autopilot. I’ve used full self-driving for many years. I have seen it get better.\r\n\r\nWarzel: Those are Tesla features.\r\n\r\nGeorge: Yeah, of course. Right. These are the self-driving Tesla features. I should say, they’re not really self-driving. This is what we would call a semi-autonomous driving-assistance system that kind of helps you on the highway or will take over some steering around town if we’re talking about full self-driving, and they’re getting better.\r\n\r\nFull self-driving tried to kill me on two separate occasions, Charlie, which really hurt my feelings. And it hasn’t done that in a while, but it’s still not a hundred percent. And for true autonomous driving to work, it has to be safer and better than a human every single time, in every single scenario.\r\n\r\nAnd they’re not there yet.\r\n\r\nWarzel: What is so difficult to put together for someone like myself—but I assume, also, a lot of different people who aren’t paying attention to Musk and Tesla, like, this granularly—we’re talking about an inability to fill the gap between the technological future of Musk’s imagination and the current moment, right? Do you think some of that is just, like, the margins of starting to, you know, suffer these consequences for not delivering?\r\n\r\nGeorge: You know, a year ago, I kind of thought if Elon ever met his Waterloo, it would be his inability to deliver on these promises of autonomy and autonomous cars. Like, it would just get to the point where that technology’s just not there yet. You know? And maybe someday it will. I think on a long enough timeline, yeah—probably humans will not be driving cars.\r\n\r\nMaybe that’s 10 years from now or 100 years from now. I don’t know. But lately, I think that what may be his greatest downfall and what may be a kind of death blow to this company is his inability to understand people. He understands technology, but he doesn’t get people. And he has said, you know, empathy is a weakness.\r\n\r\nHe doesn’t relate to other people well. You know, he’s blamed this on being neurodivergent, I guess. Either way, not a great people person. And I don’t think he counted on people abandoning the Tesla brand as furiously as they are, as quickly as they are, in response to him, in response to his actions with DOGE.\r\n\r\nI don’t think he counted on that. I think he thought he would come in and, you know, gut the federal government and be seen as this great crusader, and that everything would’ve worked out great, just the way it always has, as he’s had all this success before, right? But now, like, people are—you know, they’re running away from this company, and that might be the greatest failure of all here.\r\n\r\nWarzel: Patrick George, thank you so much for joining me on Radio Atlantic.\r\n\r\nGeorge: Thanks so much for having me, Charlie.\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nWarzel: This episode of Radio Atlantic was produced by Kevin Townsend and edited by Claudine Ebeid.

A new leak from Korean publication \r\nFinancial News\r\n (via \r\nJukanlosreve\r\n) now points to a Galaxy Unpacked event on May 13, 2025, where Samsung is expected to fully unveil the Galaxy S25 Edge, including its specs, features, color options, and pricing.\r\n \r\n\r\n                        Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge could launch on May 13\r\n               \r\n\r\n            But the US buyers will have to wait\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the report, the phone will go on sale first in China and Korea on May 23, with other markets, including the US, expected to get the device a week later on May 30. So if you're outside of Korea or China, you'll need to wait just a bit longer.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe base 256GB model will reportedly be priced at 1.5 million won (~$1,050 USD). US pricing will likely be slightly higher due to taxes and import adjustments, but the price point suggests the S25 Edge will sit between the Galaxy S25+ and \r\nGalaxy S25 Ultra\r\n, as \r\nearlier reports indicated\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Galaxy S25 Edge is expected to be Samsung's thinnest phone ever, measuring just 5.8mm at its thinnest point. It will feature a dual-camera setup on the back, as seen in previous public demos, and like the rest of the S25 lineup, it's expected to be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Galaxy S25 Edge is Samsung's push into the ultra-thin smartphone market, which is expected to heat up later this year when Apple reportedly launches its iPhone 17 Air.\r\n\r\n\r\nThankfully, we won't have to wait much longer for the thinnest Galaxy phone. With the S25 Edge expected to be officially unveiled in just over two weeks, we should expect official confirmation from Samsung within the next few days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRelated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t5 reasons I think Samsung's Galaxy S25 Edge has an edge on its rivals\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThink a slim phone is boring?

This is in no small\r\n        part due to its user base, consisting mostly of niche internet creatives and their friends — many of whom\r\n        already considered “posting” to be an art form. These users were attracted to Cohost’s opinionated,\r\n        anti-capitalist design that set it apart from the mainstream alternatives. The site was free of advertisements\r\n        and follower counts, all feeds were purely chronological, and the posting interface even supported a subset of\r\n        HTML.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    <p>It was this latter feature that conjured a community of its own. For security reasons, any post using HTML was\r\n        passed through a sanitizer to remove any malicious or malformed elements. But unlike most websites, Cohost’s\r\n        sanitizer was remarkably permissive.

By combining a checkbox, a label, and\r\n        creative use of CSS selectors, you can use the toggle functionality of the checkbox to implement all sorts of\r\n        things. Tabbed areas, push toggles, dropdown menus, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    <p>However, because this hack requires CSS selectors, that meant we couldn’t use it on Cohost — remember, we only\r\n        had inline styles. Instead, we used the relatively new\r\n        elements&nbsp;<code>&lt;details&gt;</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>&lt;summary&gt;</code>. These elements provide\r\n        the same visibility-toggling logic, but now directly in HTML. No weird CSS needed.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper resizable\" style=\"height: 350px;\"><iframe\r\n            id=\"cp_embed_LEYwJEZ\"\r\n            src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/LEYwJEZ?height=350&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=LEYwJEZ&amp;default-tab=html,result\"\r\n            height=\"350\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allowpaymentrequest=\"\"\r\n            name=\"CodePen Embed LEYwJEZ\" title=\"CodePen Embed LEYwJEZ\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\"\r\n            style=\"width: 100%; overflow: hidden; height: 100%;\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe>\r\n        <div class=\"win-size-grip\" style=\"touch-action: none;\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    <p>These elements work like so: All children of the&nbsp;<code>&lt;details&gt;</code>&nbsp;element are hidden by\r\n        default, except for the&nbsp;<code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> element. When the summary is clicked, it “opens” the\r\n        parent details element, causing its children to become visible.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    <p>We can add all sorts of styles to these elements to make this example more interesting. Below, I have styled the\r\n        constituent elements to create the effect of a button that lights up when you click on it.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper resizable\" style=\"height: 450px;\"><iframe\r\n            id=\"cp_embed_azbeaOO\"\r\n            src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/azbeaOO?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=azbeaOO&amp;default-tab=css,result\"\r\n            height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allowpaymentrequest=\"\"\r\n            name=\"CodePen Embed azbeaOO\" title=\"CodePen Embed azbeaOO\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\"\r\n            style=\"width: 100%; overflow: hidden; height: 100%;\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe>\r\n        <div class=\"win-size-grip\" style=\"touch-action: none;\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    <p>This is achieved by giving the&nbsp;<code>&lt;summary&gt;</code>&nbsp;element a fixed position and size, a grey\r\n        background color, and an outset border to make it look like a button. When it’s clicked, a\r\n        sibling&nbsp;<code>&lt;div&gt;</code>&nbsp;is revealed that covers\r\n        the&nbsp;<code>&lt;summary&gt;</code>&nbsp;with its own red background and border. Normally,\r\n        this&nbsp;<code>&lt;div&gt;</code>&nbsp;would block further click events, but I’ve given it the\r\n        declaration&nbsp;<code>pointer-events: none</code>. Now all clicks pass right on through to\r\n        the&nbsp;<code>&lt;summary&gt;</code>&nbsp;element underneath, allowing you to turn the button back off.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    <p>This is all pretty nifty, but it’s ultimately the same logic as before: something is toggled either on or off.\r\n        These are only two states. If we want to make games and other gizmos, we might want to represent hundreds to\r\n        thousands of states.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    <p>Width-hacking gives us exactly that. Consider the following example:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper resizable\" style=\"height: 450px;\"><iframe\r\n            id=\"cp_embed_RNwZPwq\"\r\n            src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/RNwZPwq?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=RNwZPwq&amp;default-tab=css,result\"\r\n            height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allowpaymentrequest=\"\"\r\n            name=\"CodePen Embed RNwZPwq\" title=\"CodePen Embed RNwZPwq\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\"\r\n            style=\"width: 100%; overflow: hidden; height: 100%;\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe>\r\n        <div class=\"win-size-grip\" style=\"touch-action: none;\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    <p>In this example, three&nbsp;<code>&lt;details&gt;</code>&nbsp;elements live together in\r\n        an&nbsp;<code>inline-flex</code>&nbsp;container. Because all the&nbsp;<code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> elements are\r\n        absolutely-positioned, the width of their respective&nbsp;<code>&lt;details&gt;</code>&nbsp;elements are all\r\n        zero when they’re closed.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    <p>Now, each of these three&nbsp;<code>&lt;details&gt;</code>&nbsp;has a\r\n        small&nbsp;<code>&lt;div&gt;</code>&nbsp;inside. The first has a child with a width of&nbsp;<code>1px</code>,\r\n        the second a child with a width of&nbsp;<code>2px</code>, and the third a width of&nbsp;<code>4px</code>. When\r\n        a&nbsp;<code>&lt;details&gt;</code>&nbsp;element is opened, it reveals its hidden&nbsp;<code>&lt;div&gt;</code>,\r\n        causing its own width to increase. This increases the width of the&nbsp;<code>inline-flex</code>&nbsp;container.\r\n        Because the width of the container is the sum of its children, this means its width&nbsp;<em>directly\r\n            corresponds</em>&nbsp;to the specific&nbsp;<code>&lt;details&gt;</code>&nbsp;elements that are open.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    <p>For example, if just the first and third&nbsp;<code>&lt;details&gt;</code>&nbsp;are open,\r\n        the&nbsp;<code>inline-flex</code>&nbsp;container will have the width&nbsp;<code>1px + 4px = 5px</code>.\r\n        Conversely, if the&nbsp;<code>inline-flex</code>&nbsp;container is&nbsp;<code>2px</code>&nbsp;wide, we can infer\r\n        that the only open&nbsp;<code>&lt;details&gt;</code>&nbsp;element is the second one. With this trick, we’ve\r\n        managed to encode all eight states of the three&nbsp;<code>&lt;details&gt;</code>&nbsp;into the width of the\r\n        container element.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    <p>This is pretty cool. Maybe we could use this as an element of some kind of puzzle game? We could show a secret\r\n        message if the right combination of buttons is checked. But how do we do that? How do we only show the secret\r\n        message for a specific width of that container div?</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper resizable\" style=\"height: 450px;\"><iframe\r\n            id=\"cp_embed_qEBeMrq\"\r\n            src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/qEBeMrq?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=qEBeMrq&amp;default-tab=css,result\"\r\n            height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allowpaymentrequest=\"\"\r\n            name=\"CodePen Embed qEBeMrq\" title=\"CodePen Embed qEBeMrq\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\"\r\n            style=\"width: 100%; overflow: hidden; height: 100%;\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe>\r\n        <div class=\"win-size-grip\" style=\"touch-action: none;\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    <p>In the preceding CodePen, I’ve added a secret message as two nested divs. Currently, this message is always\r\n        visible — complete with a TODO reminding us to implement the logic to hide it unless the correct combination is\r\n        set.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    <p>You may wonder why we’re using two nested divs for such a simple message. This is because we’ll be hiding the\r\n        message using a peculiar method: We will make the width of the parent&nbsp;<code>div.secret</code>&nbsp;be zero.\r\n        Because the&nbsp;<code>overflow: hidden</code> property is used, the\r\n        child&nbsp;<code>div.message</code>&nbsp;will be clipped, and thus invisible.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    <p>Now we’re ready to implement our secret message logic. Thanks to the fact that percentage sizes are relative to\r\n        the parent, we can use&nbsp;<code>100%</code>&nbsp;as a stand-in for the parent’s width. We can then construct a\r\n        complicated CSS&nbsp;<code>calc()</code>&nbsp;formula that is&nbsp;<code>350px</code>&nbsp;if the container div\r\n        is our target size, and&nbsp;<code>0px</code>&nbsp;otherwise. With that, our secret message will be visible only\r\n        when the center button is active and the others are inactive. Give it a try!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper resizable\" style=\"height: 450px;\"><iframe\r\n            id=\"cp_embed_ByaXOZP\"\r\n            src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/ByaXOZP?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=ByaXOZP&amp;default-tab=css,result\"\r\n            height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allowpaymentrequest=\"\"\r\n            name=\"CodePen Embed ByaXOZP\" title=\"CodePen Embed ByaXOZP\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\"\r\n            style=\"width: 100%; overflow: hidden; height: 100%;\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe>\r\n        <div class=\"win-size-grip\" style=\"touch-action: none;\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    <p>This complicated&nbsp;<code>calc()</code>&nbsp;function that’s controlling the secret div’s width has the\r\n        following graph:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"715\"\r\n            height=\"400\"\r\n            src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/indicator_function_plain.jpg?resize=715%2C400&amp;ssl=1\"\r\n            alt=\"Line chart showing the width of the secret div when the container div is at different widths.\"\r\n            class=\"wp-image-385857\"\r\n            srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/indicator_function_plain.jpg?w=715&amp;ssl=1 715w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/indicator_function_plain.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1 300w\"\r\n            sizes=\"(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\"></figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    <p>You can see that it’s a piecewise linear curve, constructed from multiple pieces\r\n        using&nbsp;<code>min</code>/<code>max</code>.

But what if we want our games to\r\n        look&nbsp;<em>good</em>? What if we want to add&nbsp;<em>✨animations</em>?✨ Believe it or not, this is actually\r\n        possible entirely within inline CSS using the power of SVG.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    <p>SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is an XML-based image format for storing vector images. It enjoys broad support on\r\n        the web — you can use it in&nbsp;<code>&lt;img&gt;</code>&nbsp;elements or as the URL of\r\n        a&nbsp;<code>background-image</code>&nbsp;property, among other things.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    <p>Like HTML, an SVG file is a collection of&nbsp;<em>elements</em>. For SVG, these elements are things\r\n        like&nbsp;<code>&lt;rect&gt;</code>,&nbsp;<code>&lt;circle&gt;</code>, and&nbsp;<code>&lt;text&gt;</code>, to\r\n        name a few. These elements can have all sorts of properties defined, such as fill color, stroke width, and font\r\n        family.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    <p>A lesser-known feature of SVG is that it can contain&nbsp;<code>&lt;style&gt;</code>&nbsp;blocks for configuring\r\n        the properties of these elements. In the example below, an SVG is used as the background for a div. Inside that\r\n        SVG is a&nbsp;<code>&lt;style&gt;</code>&nbsp;block that sets the&nbsp;<code>fill</code>color of\r\n        its&nbsp;<code>&lt;circle&gt;</code>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<code>red</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper resizable\" style=\"height: 450px;\"><iframe\r\n            id=\"cp_embed_YPzmObL\"\r\n            src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/YPzmObL?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=YPzmObL&amp;default-tab=result\"\r\n            height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allowpaymentrequest=\"\"\r\n            name=\"CodePen Embed YPzmObL\" title=\"CodePen Embed YPzmObL\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\"\r\n            style=\"width: 100%; overflow: hidden; height: 100%;\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe>\r\n        <div class=\"win-size-grip\" style=\"touch-action: none;\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    <p>An even&nbsp;<i>lesser-known</i> feature of SVG is that its styles can use&nbsp;<em>media queries</em>. The size\r\n        used by those queries is the size of the div it is a background of.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    <p>In the following example, we have a resizable&nbsp;<code>&lt;div&gt;</code>&nbsp;with an SVG background.

Turns out you can use CSS\r\n        animations&nbsp;<em>within</em>&nbsp;SVGs.

But before you try this yourself, be sure to look at the source code carefully. You’ll notice that I’ve\r\n        had to add a&nbsp;<code>1</code>×<code>1px</code>, off-screen element with the ID&nbsp;<code>#hack</code>. This\r\n        element has a very simple (and nearly unnoticeable) continuous animation applied. A “dummy animation” like this\r\n        is necessary to get around some web browsers’ buggy detection of SVG animation. Without that hack,\r\n        our&nbsp;<code>transition</code>&nbsp;property wouldn’t work consistently.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    <p>For the fun of it, let’s combine this tech with our previous secret message example. Instead of toggling the\r\n        secret message’s width between the values of&nbsp;<code>0px</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>350px</code>, I’ve\r\n        adjusted the calc formula so that the secret message div is normally&nbsp;<code>350px</code>, and\r\n        becomes&nbsp;<code>351px</code>&nbsp;if the right combination is set.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    <p>Instead of HTML/CSS, the secret message is now just an SVG background with\r\n        a&nbsp;<code>&lt;text&gt;</code>&nbsp;element that says “secret message.” Using media queries, we change the\r\n        transform scale of this&nbsp;<code>&lt;text&gt;</code>&nbsp;to be zero unless the div\r\n        is&nbsp;<code>351px</code>. With the&nbsp;<code>transition</code>&nbsp;property applied, we get a smooth\r\n        transition between these two states.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    <p>Click the center button to activate the secret message:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper resizable\" style=\"height: 450px;\"><iframe\r\n            id=\"cp_embed_GgRVYNe\"\r\n            src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/GgRVYNe?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=GgRVYNe&amp;default-tab=css,result\"\r\n            height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allowpaymentrequest=\"\"\r\n            name=\"CodePen Embed GgRVYNe\" title=\"CodePen Embed GgRVYNe\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\"\r\n            style=\"width: 100%; overflow: hidden; height: 100%;\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe>\r\n        <div class=\"win-size-grip\" style=\"touch-action: none;\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    <p>The first cohost user to discover the use of media queries within SVG backgrounds was @ticky for&nbsp;<a\r\n            href=\"https://cohost.org/ticky/post/27259-div-style-position\" rel=\"noopener\">this post</a>.

The bespoke, Tumblr-like social media website came and went in a flash. Going public in June 2022 with invite-only registrations, Cohost’s peach and maroon landing page promised that it would be “posting, but better.” Just over two years later, in September 2024, the site announced its shutdown, its creators citing burnout and funding problems. Today, its servers are gone for good. Any link to cohost.org redirects to the Wayback Machine’s slow but comprehensive archive.\r\n\r\nThe landing page for Cohost.org, featuring our beloved eggbug.\r\n\r\nDespite its short lifetime, I am confident in saying that Cohost delivered on its promise. This is in no small part due to its user base, consisting mostly of niche internet creatives and their friends — many of whom already considered “posting” to be an art form. These users were attracted to Cohost’s opinionated, anti-capitalist design that set it apart from the mainstream alternatives. The site was free of advertisements and follower counts, all feeds were purely chronological, and the posting interface even supported a subset of HTML.\r\n\r\nIt was this latter feature that conjured a community of its own. For security reasons, any post using HTML was passed through a sanitizer to remove any malicious or malformed elements. But unlike most websites, Cohost’s sanitizer was remarkably permissive. The vast majority of tags and attributes were allowed — most notably inline CSS styles on arbitrary elements.\r\n\r\nUsers didn’t take long to grasp the creative opportunities lurking within Cohost’s unassuming “new post” modal. Within 48 hours of going public, the fledgling community had figured out how to post poetry using the <details> tag, port the Apple homepage from 1999, and reimplement a quick-time WarioWare game. We called posts like these “CSS Crimes,” and the people who made them “CSS Criminals.” Without even intending to, the developers of Cohost had created an environment for a CSS community to thrive.\r\n\r\nIn this post, I’ll show you a few of the hacks we found while trying to push the limits of Cohost’s HTML support. Use these if you dare, lest you too get labelled a CSS criminal.\r\n\r\nMany of the CSS crimes of Cohost were powered by a technique that user @corncycle dubbed “width-hacking.” Using a combination of the <details> element and the CSS calc() function, we can get some pretty wild functionality: combination locks, tile matching games, Zelda-style top-down movement, the list goes on.\r\n\r\nIf you’ve been around the CSS world for a while, there’s a good chance you’ve been exposed to the old checkbox hack. By combining a checkbox, a label, and creative use of CSS selectors, you can use the toggle functionality of the checkbox to implement all sorts of things. Tabbed areas, push toggles, dropdown menus, etc.\r\n\r\nHowever, because this hack requires CSS selectors, that meant we couldn’t use it on Cohost — remember, we only had inline styles. Instead, we used the relatively new elements <details> and <summary> . These elements provide the same visibility-toggling logic, but now directly in HTML. No weird CSS needed.\r\n\r\nCodePen Embed Fallback\r\n\r\nThese elements work like so: All children of the <details> element are hidden by default, except for the <summary> element. When the summary is clicked, it “opens” the parent details element, causing its children to become visible.\r\n\r\nWe can add all sorts of styles to these elements to make this example more interesting. Below, I have styled the constituent elements to create the effect of a button that lights up when you click on it.\r\n\r\nCodePen Embed Fallback\r\n\r\nThis is achieved by giving the <summary> element a fixed position and size, a grey background color, and an outset border to make it look like a button. When it’s clicked, a sibling <div> is revealed that covers the <summary> with its own red background and border. Normally, this <div> would block further click events, but I’ve given it the declaration pointer-events: none . Now all clicks pass right on through to the <summary> element underneath, allowing you to turn the button back off.\r\n\r\nThis is all pretty nifty, but it’s ultimately the same logic as before: something is toggled either on or off. These are only two states. If we want to make games and other gizmos, we might want to represent hundreds to thousands of states.\r\n\r\nWidth-hacking gives us exactly that. Consider the following example:\r\n\r\nCodePen Embed Fallback\r\n\r\nIn this example, three <details> elements live together in an inline-flex container. Because all the <summary> elements are absolutely-positioned, the width of their respective <details> elements are all zero when they’re closed.\r\n\r\nNow, each of these three <details> has a small <div> inside. The first has a child with a width of 1px , the second a child with a width of 2px , and the third a width of 4px . When a <details> element is opened, it reveals its hidden <div> , causing its own width to increase. This increases the width of the inline-flex container. Because the width of the container is the sum of its children, this means its width directly corresponds to the specific <details> elements that are open.\r\n\r\nFor example, if just the first and third <details> are open, the inline-flex container will have the width 1px + 4px = 5px . Conversely, if the inline-flex container is 2px wide, we can infer that the only open <details> element is the second one. With this trick, we’ve managed to encode all eight states of the three <details> into the width of the container element.\r\n\r\nThis is pretty cool. Maybe we could use this as an element of some kind of puzzle game? We could show a secret message if the right combination of buttons is checked. But how do we do that? How do we only show the secret message for a specific width of that container div?\r\n\r\nCodePen Embed Fallback\r\n\r\nIn the preceding CodePen, I’ve added a secret message as two nested divs. Currently, this message is always visible — complete with a TODO reminding us to implement the logic to hide it unless the correct combination is set.\r\n\r\nYou may wonder why we’re using two nested divs for such a simple message. This is because we’ll be hiding the message using a peculiar method: We will make the width of the parent div.secret be zero. Because the overflow: hidden property is used, the child div.message will be clipped, and thus invisible.\r\n\r\nNow we’re ready to implement our secret message logic. Thanks to the fact that percentage sizes are relative to the parent, we can use 100% as a stand-in for the parent’s width. We can then construct a complicated CSS calc() formula that is 350px if the container div is our target size, and 0px otherwise. With that, our secret message will be visible only when the center button is active and the others are inactive. Give it a try!\r\n\r\nCodePen Embed Fallback\r\n\r\nThis complicated calc() function that’s controlling the secret div’s width has the following graph:\r\n\r\nYou can see that it’s a piecewise linear curve, constructed from multiple pieces using min / max . These pieces are placed in just the right spots so that the function maxes out when the container div is 2px — which we’ve established is precisely when only the second button is active.\r\n\r\nA surprising variety of games can be implemented using variations on this technique. Here is a tower of Hanoi game I had made that uses both width and height to track the game’s state.\r\n\r\nSVG animation\r\n\r\nSo far, we’ve seen some basic functionality for implementing a game. But what if we want our games to look good? What if we want to add ✨animations?✨ Believe it or not, this is actually possible entirely within inline CSS using the power of SVG.\r\n\r\nSVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is an XML-based image format for storing vector images. It enjoys broad support on the web — you can use it in <img> elements or as the URL of a background-image property, among other things.\r\n\r\nLike HTML, an SVG file is a collection of elements. For SVG, these elements are things like <rect> , <circle> , and <text> , to name a few. These elements can have all sorts of properties defined, such as fill color, stroke width, and font family.\r\n\r\nA lesser-known feature of SVG is that it can contain <style> blocks for configuring the properties of these elements. In the example below, an SVG is used as the background for a div. Inside that SVG is a <style> block that sets the fill color of its <circle> to red .\r\n\r\nCodePen Embed Fallback\r\n\r\nAn even lesser-known feature of SVG is that its styles can use media queries. The size used by those queries is the size of the div it is a background of.\r\n\r\nIn the following example, we have a resizable <div> with an SVG background. Inside this SVG is a media query which will change the fill color of its <circle> to blue when the width exceeds 100px . Grab the resize handle in its bottom right corner and drag until the circle turns blue.\r\n\r\nCodePen Embed Fallback\r\n\r\nBecause resize handles don’t quite work on mobile, unfortunately, this and the next couple of CodePens are best experienced on desktop.\r\n\r\nThis is an extremely powerful technique. By mixing it with width-hacking, we could encode the state of a game or gizmo in the width of an SVG background image. This SVG can then show or hide specific elements depending on the corresponding game state via media queries.\r\n\r\nBut I promised you animations. So, how is that done? Turns out you can use CSS animations within SVGs. By using the CSS transition property, we can make the color of our circle smoothly transition from red to blue .\r\n\r\nCodePen Embed Fallback\r\n\r\nAmazing! But before you try this yourself, be sure to look at the source code carefully. You’ll notice that I’ve had to add a 1 × 1px , off-screen element with the ID #hack . This element has a very simple (and nearly unnoticeable) continuous animation applied. A “dummy animation” like this is necessary to get around some web browsers’ buggy detection of SVG animation. Without that hack, our transition property wouldn’t work consistently.\r\n\r\nFor the fun of it, let’s combine this tech with our previous secret message example. Instead of toggling the secret message’s width between the values of 0px and 350px , I’ve adjusted the calc formula so that the secret message div is normally 350px , and becomes 351px if the right combination is set.\r\n\r\nInstead of HTML/CSS, the secret message is now just an SVG background with a <text> element that says “secret message.” Using media queries, we change the transform scale of this <text> to be zero unless the div is 351px . With the transition property applied, we get a smooth transition between these two states.\r\n\r\nClick the center button to activate the secret message:\r\n\r\nCodePen Embed Fallback\r\n\r\nThe first cohost user to discover the use of media queries within SVG backgrounds was @ticky for this post. I don’t recall who figured out they could animate, but I used the tech quite extensively for this quiz that tells you what kind of soil you’d like if you were a worm.\r\n\r\nWrapping up\r\n\r\nAnd that’s will be all for now.

If you’d like to explore the world of CSS crimes further, I’d recommend this great linkdump by YellowAfterlife, or this video retrospective by rebane2001.\r\n\r\nIt will always hurt to describe Cohost in the past tense.

This is an affirmative stance towards reality where, even if things are bad or uncomfortable or horrible, we’re going to affirm reality as it is and not idealize it into something that it’s not. It’s very common for people to do, even when they’re not religious, to think of reality as though it owes you something. But to affirm reality fully is to accept the good, the bad.

Why do you need philosophy? And what that point misses is that philosophy is how we got to the point where we’re looking at the world in the way we do now.”\r\n\r\n— Stephen West\r\n\r\n“I don’t give advice, because if a person is asking for advice, typically, they’re not the person that really takes the advice — so it’s almost always a waste of your time. But if you’re the one that genuinely takes advice, and it’s ironically me giving you advice to be the one that takes advice, but if you can do that, if you can manage that, then you won’t need advice here in six months — you’ll be the one giving it.”\r\n\r\n— Stephen West\r\n\r\n“The highest level of abstraction in any field is going to be philosophy. If you’re somebody well-educated … at the top of your field, in order to make progress in that field, you have to subvert the existing set of protocols and assumptions, axiomatically, that are going on in that field. To move the field forward, you have to be doing philosophy.”\r\n\r\n— Stephen West\r\n\r\n“I really do sacrifice efficiency for meaning pretty often.”\r\n\r\n— Stephen West\r\n\r\n“You don’t need to be a genius. You just need to be saying something that resonates with other people.”\r\n\r\n— Stephen West\r\n\r\n“Simon Blackburn … describes philosophy as conceptual engineering. It’s a great metaphor. If an engineer looks at a bridge and they know about the raw materials of the bridge and they know how they connect to other parts of the bridge and everything, if you can show an engineer one bridge, a particular bridge, and he’d be like, ‘Well, it holds weight over here, but if we put weight over on this side, it’s going to all start crumbling down.’ Philosophers do this with world views.”\r\n\r\n— Stephen West\r\n\r\n“A way I’ve heard [philosophy] described is it’s the disruption of common sense. I mean, what is looking at the world at all? It’s an approximation. We are works in progress. I look at the world one way for a while, and everybody knows what it’s like to change the way that you see everything in the world. I just think that philosophy is the method of doing that.”\r\n\r\n— Stephen West\r\n\r\n“Nietzsche said ‘amor fati’ is how he’s going to live his life. Henceforth, he decided everything he’s going to say yes to. He will be a yes-sayer, is what he says. This is an affirmative stance towards reality where, even if things are bad or uncomfortable or horrible, we’re going to affirm reality as it is and not idealize it into something that it’s not. It’s very common for people to do, even when they’re not religious, is to think of reality as though it owes you something. But to affirm reality fully is to accept the good, the bad. It’s not to rationalize about it and to try to make excuses for it or frame your suffering in a way where it makes it go away. To truly affirm life and reality is just to be in it and to have life itself be enough, truly.”\r\n\r\n— Stephen West\r\n\r\nRelated\r\n\r\nThe Tim Ferriss Show is one of the most popular podcasts in the world with more than one billion downloads.

And Samsung began selling its\r\n        smartwatches two years before Apple began.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h2 class=\" col-sm-12\" data-anchor=\"developing-the-apple-watch\" id=\"developing-the-apple-watch\">Developing the Apple\r\n        Watch</h2>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">Apple's now ex-chief designer <a href=\"https://appleinsider.com/inside/jony-ive\"\r\n            title=\"Jony Ive\" data-kpt=\"1\">Jony Ive</a> has claimed that discussions about the Apple Watch didn't start\r\n        until early 2012, and specifically after the death of <a href=\"https://appleinsider.com/inside/steve-jobs\"\r\n            title=\"Steve Jobs\" data-kpt=\"1\">Steve Jobs</a> the year before. The <em>New York Times</em> wants to differ,\r\n        though, as it said in December 2011 that Apple had been working on a watch \"over the last year.\"\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">\"A person with knowledge of the company's plans told me that a 'very small group of Apple\r\n        employees' had been conceptualizing and even prototyping some wearable devices,\" <a\r\n            href=\"https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/18/wearing-your-computer-on-your-sleeve/\">he wrote</a>. \"One\r\n        idea being discussed is a curved-glass iPod that would wrap around the wrist; people could communicate with the\r\n        device using <a href=\"https://appleinsider.com/inside/siri\" title=\"Siri\" data-kpt=\"1\">Siri</a>, the company's\r\n        artificial intelligence software.\"\r\n    </p>\r\n    <div class=\" col-sm-12 align-center\"><a\r\n            href=\"https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/63409-131768-888-patent-xl.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img\r\n                src=\"https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/63409-131768-888-patent-xl.jpg\"\r\n                alt=\"A sketch of an open hand wearing a wristband labeled 'CONTINUUM' with an arrow pointing to the wristband marked 408.\"\r\n                height=\"416\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img-responsive article-image\"></a>\r\n        <span class=\"carousel-caption\">Hidden in an early 2010s patent was this Apple Watch design</span>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">\"The brain that brings all these things together is the smartphone, which after all is really\r\n        the first wearable computer,\" he continued. \"Researchers note that the smartphone is almost never more than\r\n        three feet away from its user.\"\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">In a disagreement between Ive and the <em>New York Times</em> over Ive's own work, you have to\r\n        side with the designer. Except there was an Apple patent application that mentioned \"a wrist-watch device\" — and\r\n        that application was in <a\r\n            href=\"https://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=8,044,873.PN.&amp;OS=PN/8,044,873&amp;RS=PN/8,044,873\">December\r\n            2007</a>.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">Patents always try to cover the greatest possible number of uses of the technology they\r\n        describe, the better to help with any future legal cases. But even if it were only a passing thought in 2007, it\r\n        was still a passing thought about an Apple Watch.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">Not only was it a thought for someone at Apple, there were AppleInsider forum members asking\r\n        about a Watch. They were asking about it even earlier, <a\r\n            href=\"https://forums.appleinsider.com/discussion/57401/apple-unveils-ipod-nano/p4\">in 2005</a>, and for one\r\n        clear reason.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">At that point, Apple had launched the iPod nano and it was so small that it could be worn as a\r\n        watch. And people did it, people did convert their iPod nano devices into a watch.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">It's a long road from an iPod that plays music, to a device that <a\r\n            href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/09/05/pregnant-cardiologist-says-apple-watch-saved-her-and-her-baby\">actually\r\n            saves lives</a>. But the demand was there and the idea was there.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h2 class=\" col-sm-12\" data-anchor=\"the-clues-kept-coming\" id=\"the-clues-kept-coming\">The clues kept coming</h2>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">That 2007 patent may or may not have been serious, by 2013 there was no doubt. While it could\r\n        still have chosen not to go further — see the <a href=\"https://appleinsider.com/inside/apple-car\"\r\n            title=\"Apple Car\" data-kpt=\"1\">Apple Car</a> and how that <a\r\n            href=\"https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=apple+car+cancelled+site%3Aappleinsider.com&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8\">project\r\n            was cancelled</a> — Apple was very seriously researching a watch.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">Forget trying to cover all bases, <a\r\n            href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/13/02/21/apple-patent-filing-points-directly-to-iwatch-concept-with-flexible-touchscreen-display\">another\r\n            patent</a> was for a \"bi-stable spring with flexible display,\" and its illustrative diagrams include ones\r\n        with such a device worn on the wrist. Apple called it a bracelet, so perhaps it wasn't then confident of getting\r\n        everything into a watch-sized device, but it was trying.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">\"With a touch screen user input a user can accomplish a number of different tasks including\r\n        adjusting the order of a current playlist, and reviewing a list of recent phone calls,\" said the patent. \"A\r\n        response to a current text message can even be managed given a simple virtual keyboard configuration across the\r\n        face of the flexible display.\"\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">In retrospect, we can see just how serious Apple was, and not just because we now have Apple\r\n        Watches. In that same year of 2013, former Adobe chief technology officer Kevin Lynch joined Apple as a —\r\n        something.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">Even he didn't know. Seriously.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">Lynch was hired before being told what he would be working on. And if that's a sign of secrecy,\r\n        this is a sign of the state of progress on the Apple Watch at that time — Lynch had to skip Apple's usual\r\n        induction program.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">Instead, he went straight to the Apple Watch studio. He wasn't working on his own and he wasn't\r\n        working with a blank slate, but he also wasn't working with any functioning Apple Watches. Or a functioning <a\r\n            href=\"https://appleinsider.com/inside/watchos\" title=\"watchOS\" data-kpt=\"1\">watchOS</a>.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">Lynch joined Apple in March 2013. Then in September 2014, <a\r\n            href=\"https://appleinsider.com/inside/tim-cook\" title=\"Tim Cook\" data-kpt=\"1\">Tim Cook</a> formally\r\n        announced the Apple Watch.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h2 class=\" col-sm-12\" data-anchor=\"announcing-and-launching-the-apple-watch\"\r\n        id=\"announcing-and-launching-the-apple-watch\">Announcing and launching the Apple Watch</h2>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">It's a very long time since Apple has been able to reveal a device and say \"available today.\"\r\n        That's partly because of the sheer scale it has to work at now, and partly because so many of its devices have\r\n        to go through the FCC approval process.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">Rather than wait for any possible leaks from that process, Apple steps out into the spotlight\r\n        first. And on September 9, 2014, Apple unveiled the iPhone 6.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <div class=\"col-sm-12 embed align-center\">\r\n        <div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 video-holder\">\r\n            <div class=\"video-wrapper\">\r\n                <iframe\r\n                src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/38IqQpwPe7s\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\"\r\n                allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"\r\n                allowfullscreen=\"\" class=\"embed-responsive-item\" loading=\"lazy\">\r\n            </iframe>\r\n            </div>\r\n            \r\n            \r\n    </div>\r\n    <script\r\n        type=\"application/ld+json\">{\"@context\":\"https://schema.org/\",\"@type\":\"VideoObject\",\"name\":\"Apple &mdash;   September Event 2014\",\"description\":\"From the launch of Apple Watch to the arrival of iPhone 6 to a live performance from U2, this is an event not to be missed.\",\"thumbnailUrl\":\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/38IqQpwPe7s/sddefault.jpg\",\"uploadDate\":\"2014-09-11T04:26:17Z\",\"duration\":\"PT2H3M26S\",\"embedUrl\":\"https://www.youtube.com/watch/?v=38IqQpwPe7s\"}</script>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">And the iPhone 6 Plus.

It shoved U2 into our iTunes libraries.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">\"We've really gone through enough to call it day,\" said Cook. \"But we're not quite finished\r\n        yet. We have one more thing.\"\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">\"We love to make great products that really enrich people's lives,\" he continued. \"We love to\r\n        integrate hardware, software, and services seamlessly.

It is the next chapter in\r\n        Apple's story,\" he concluded in his low-key, downbeat kind of style.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h2 class=\" col-sm-12\" data-anchor=\"one-wait-ended-another-began\" id=\"one-wait-ended-another-began\">One wait ended,\r\n        another began</h2>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">After years upon years of heightened speculation only really equalled since by the <a\r\n            href=\"https://appleinsider.com/inside/apple-vision-pro\" title=\"Apple Vision Pro\" data-kpt=\"1\">Apple Vision\r\n            Pro</a>, the Apple Watch was real — and nobody could buy one. Not for another 227 days until April 24, 2015.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">During that time, Cook even had to <a\r\n            href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/15/01/27/apple-watch-on-track-to-ship-in-april-ceo-tim-cook-says\">reassure\r\n            us all</a> that the Apple Watch really was launching. And if we believed him about the launch date, plenty\r\n        of people did not buy a word of his hype about the device in general.\r\n    </p>\r\n    \r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\"><em>AppleInsider</em> was cautious about it, too, and in a way that now seems prescient — or at\r\n        least practical.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">\"We believe the Apple Watch has huge potential, and very real benefits right now,\" we said <a\r\n            href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/15/04/29/review-apple-watch-is-beautiful-but-rough-around-the-edges\">at\r\n            the time</a>. \"But if the decision is to buy a Watch now or wait until the next generation, and you're not\r\n        the typical early adopter, maybe you should wait. Or at the very least, buy the cheapest Sport model you can.\"\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h2 class=\" col-sm-12\" data-anchor=\"renumbering-the-apple-watch\" id=\"renumbering-the-apple-watch\">Renumbering the\r\n        Apple Watch</h2>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">What arrived on people's wrists starting April 24, 2015, was just called the Apple Watch. Or it\r\n        was called ludicrously expensive, if you went for the gold-plated edtion.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">Fast forward a year to September 2016, and suddenly the Apple Watch had numbers. Lots of them.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">There was the brand-new Apple Watch Series 2, but also a revised version of the original, now\r\n        called Apple Watch Series 1. The original original, the un-revised one, started to be known as the Series 0.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">After that, and to this day, there has been a new Apple Watch every year. It would be highly\r\n        unusual if 2025 didn't see an <a href=\"https://appleinsider.com/inside/apple-watch-series-11\"\r\n            title=\"Apple Watch Series 11\" data-kpt=\"1\">Apple Watch Series 11</a> in September.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">It would also be unusual if absolutely every year saw a major change, a truly major improvement\r\n        in the Apple Watch. But such a change did happen with the <a\r\n            href=\"https://appleinsider.com/inside/apple-watch-series-4\" title=\"Apple Watch Series 4\" data-kpt=\"1\">Apple\r\n            Watch Series 4</a> in 2018.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">\"Every bone in my body tells me this is very significant,\" Jony Ive said <a\r\n            href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/09/13/apple-watch-series-4-a-tipping-point-can-make-a-material-difference-for-people-says-jony-ive\">at\r\n            the time</a>. \"I'm so zealous about the Watch because I see it as making a material difference to people's\r\n        quality of life and actually their ability to be alive.\"\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">By the time of the Apple Watch Series 4, Apple was seeing its role as very clearly one to do\r\n        with health. Previously it might have been health, might have been fashion, and it might have been anything, but\r\n        now Apple knew what it had.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">And it added an EKG to the Apple Watch Series 4. It has kept adding new health features ever\r\n        since — or sometimes, it <a\r\n            href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/03/31/apple-watch-series-10-almost-had-a-new-health-sensor\">at\r\n            least tried to</a>.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <div class=\" col-sm-12 align-center\"><a\r\n            href=\"https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/63409-131764-888-Blood-Oxygen-xl.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img\r\n                src=\"https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/63409-131764-888-Blood-Oxygen-xl.jpg\"\r\n                alt=\"Smartwatch on wrist displaying blood oxygen level at 97%, with blue and pink watchband, alongside a silver chain bracelet.\"\r\n                height=\"731\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img-responsive article-image\"></a>\r\n        <span class=\"carousel-caption\">Apple Watch's blood oxygen sensor</span>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">One of those health features concerned using light to measure blood oxygen levels.

Masimos versus Apple may never be sorted out, but in the meantime Apple <a\r\n            href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/11/04/masimos-claims-falter-as-apple-defends-smartwatch-designs-in-court\">has\r\n            disabled</a> that blood oxygen sensor — and Masimos's CEO has <a\r\n            href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/09/26/masimo-ceo-steps-down-but-not-because-of-apple-watch-dispute\">stepped\r\n            down</a>.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h2 class=\" col-sm-12\" data-anchor=\"beyond-the-apple-watch\" id=\"beyond-the-apple-watch\">Beyond the Apple Watch</h2>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">Masimo's legal challenge wasn't only about the Apple Watch Series 9. It also covered the <a\r\n            href=\"https://appleinsider.com/inside/apple-watch-ultra\" title=\"Apple Watch Ultra\" data-kpt=\"1\">Apple Watch\r\n            Ultra</a>.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">The first version of that was <a\r\n            href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/09/30/apple-watch-ultra-review-ambitious-aspirations\">launched in\r\n            2022</a>, bringing with it a larger screen, greater waterproofing for divers — and an Action Button. That\r\n        customizable physical button has since spread to the iPhone, but it began on the Apple Watch Ultra.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">While this larger model doesn't get updated every year, or at least not significantly, nor does\r\n        the other newer entrant to the range. <a href=\"https://appleinsider.com/inside/apple-watch-se\"\r\n            title=\"Apple Watch SE\" data-kpt=\"1\">Apple Watch SE</a> was launched even earlier than the Apple Watch Ultra,\r\n        coming out <a\r\n            href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/10/06/review-apple-watch-se-is-the-smartwatch-for-first-time-buyers-and-upgrade-holdouts\">in\r\n            2020</a> — and without any blood oxygen feature to trip it up in lawsuits.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <div class=\" col-sm-12 align-center\"><a\r\n            href=\"https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/63409-131765-888-Apple-Watch-Ultra-xl.jpg\"\r\n            target=\"_blank\"><img\r\n                src=\"https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/63409-131765-888-Apple-Watch-Ultra-xl.jpg\"\r\n                alt=\"A dark smartwatch displays a red compass and navigation interface with various symbols and numbers on its screen.\"\r\n                height=\"738\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img-responsive article-image\"></a>\r\n        <span class=\"carousel-caption\">Apple Watch Ultra looks cool.

In practice, adults and coach-potatoes wear\r\n        either, but Apple has at least spaced the models out at steadily higher price points.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h2 class=\" col-sm-12\" data-anchor=\"ten-years-on\" id=\"ten-years-on\">Ten years on</h2>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">Maybe because a watch is such a personal device, but it does still feel as if the Apple Watch\r\n        is a new product — until you see an Apple Watch Series 0 again.

It's not true that everyone stopped, but a noticeable number did — and then it seemed as if they all came back in 2015.\r\n\r\nFor years before then, the very idea of an \"iWatch\" was both mocked and longed for. After it was launched in 2015, after Apple Watch became a reality, it was still mocked a little, and it was still longed for a lot.\r\n\r\nBut it was also bought. Today, according to statistics collated by Business of Apps, up to the end 2024, Apple has sold over 300 million of the Apple Watch.\r\n\r\nThat has to be an approximation as Apple does not release figures, but then neither does Samsung. Based on similar approximations by Sammobile, though, it's estimated that Samsung has sold over 100 million smartwatches.\r\n\r\nThat's a huge number, but it's only a third of Apple's sales. And Samsung began selling its smartwatches two years before Apple began.\r\n\r\nDeveloping the Apple Watch\r\n\r\nApple's now ex-chief designer Jony Ive has claimed that discussions about the Apple Watch didn't start until early 2012, and specifically after the death of Steve Jobs the year before. The New York Times wants to differ, though, as it said in December 2011 that Apple had been working on a watch \"over the last year.\"\r\n\r\n\"A person with knowledge of the company's plans told me that a 'very small group of Apple employees' had been conceptualizing and even prototyping some wearable devices,\" he wrote. \"One idea being discussed is a curved-glass iPod that would wrap around the wrist; people could communicate with the device using Siri, the company's artificial intelligence software.\"\r\n\r\nHidden in an early 2010s patent was this Apple Watch design\r\n\r\n\"The brain that brings all these things together is the smartphone, which after all is really the first wearable computer,\" he continued. \"Researchers note that the smartphone is almost never more than three feet away from its user.\"\r\n\r\nIn a disagreement between Ive and the New York Times over Ive's own work, you have to side with the designer. Except there was an Apple patent application that mentioned \"a wrist-watch device\" — and that application was in December 2007.\r\n\r\nPatents always try to cover the greatest possible number of uses of the technology they describe, the better to help with any future legal cases. But even if it were only a passing thought in 2007, it was still a passing thought about an Apple Watch.\r\n\r\nNot only was it a thought for someone at Apple, there were AppleInsider forum members asking about a Watch. They were asking about it even earlier, in 2005, and for one clear reason.\r\n\r\nAt that point, Apple had launched the iPod nano and it was so small that it could be worn as a watch. And people did it, people did convert their iPod nano devices into a watch.\r\n\r\nIt's a long road from an iPod that plays music, to a device that actually saves lives. But the demand was there and the idea was there.\r\n\r\nThe clues kept coming\r\n\r\nThat 2007 patent may or may not have been serious, by 2013 there was no doubt. While it could still have chosen not to go further — see the Apple Car and how that project was cancelled — Apple was very seriously researching a watch.\r\n\r\nForget trying to cover all bases, another patent was for a \"bi-stable spring with flexible display,\" and its illustrative diagrams include ones with such a device worn on the wrist. Apple called it a bracelet, so perhaps it wasn't then confident of getting everything into a watch-sized device, but it was trying.\r\n\r\n\"With a touch screen user input a user can accomplish a number of different tasks including adjusting the order of a current playlist, and reviewing a list of recent phone calls,\" said the patent. \"A response to a current text message can even be managed given a simple virtual keyboard configuration across the face of the flexible display.\"\r\n\r\nIn retrospect, we can see just how serious Apple was, and not just because we now have Apple Watches. In that same year of 2013, former Adobe chief technology officer Kevin Lynch joined Apple as a — something.\r\n\r\nEven he didn't know. Seriously.\r\n\r\nLynch was hired before being told what he would be working on. And if that's a sign of secrecy, this is a sign of the state of progress on the Apple Watch at that time — Lynch had to skip Apple's usual induction program.\r\n\r\nInstead, he went straight to the Apple Watch studio. He wasn't working on his own and he wasn't working with a blank slate, but he also wasn't working with any functioning Apple Watches. Or a functioning watchOS.\r\n\r\nLynch joined Apple in March 2013. Then in September 2014, Tim Cook formally announced the Apple Watch.\r\n\r\nAnnouncing and launching the Apple Watch\r\n\r\nIt's a very long time since Apple has been able to reveal a device and say \"available today.\" That's partly because of the sheer scale it has to work at now, and partly because so many of its devices have to go through the FCC approval process.\r\n\r\nRather than wait for any possible leaks from that process, Apple steps out into the spotlight first. And on September 9, 2014, Apple unveiled the iPhone 6.\r\n\r\nAnd the iPhone 6 Plus. It unveiled Apple Pay. It shoved U2 into our iTunes libraries.\r\n\r\n\"We've really gone through enough to call it day,\" said Cook. \"But we're not quite finished yet. We have one more thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"We love to make great products that really enrich people's lives,\" he continued. \"We love to integrate hardware, software, and services seamlessly. We love to make technology more personal, and allow our users to do things that they could never have imagined.\"\r\n\r\n\"We've been working incredibly hard for a long time on an entirely new product,\" he said. \"And we believe this product will redefine what people expect from its category.\"\r\n\r\nI am so excited and I am so proud to share it with you this morning. It is the next chapter in Apple's story,\" he concluded in his low-key, downbeat kind of style.\r\n\r\nOne wait ended, another began\r\n\r\nAfter years upon years of heightened speculation only really equalled since by the Apple Vision Pro, the Apple Watch was real — and nobody could buy one. Not for another 227 days until April 24, 2015.\r\n\r\nDuring that time, Cook even had to reassure us all that the Apple Watch really was launching. And if we believed him about the launch date, plenty of people did not buy a word of his hype about the device in general.\r\n\r\nAppleInsider was cautious about it, too, and in a way that now seems prescient — or at least practical.\r\n\r\n\"We believe the Apple Watch has huge potential, and very real benefits right now,\" we said at the time. \"But if the decision is to buy a Watch now or wait until the next generation, and you're not the typical early adopter, maybe you should wait. Or at the very least, buy the cheapest Sport model you can.\"\r\n\r\nRenumbering the Apple Watch\r\n\r\nWhat arrived on people's wrists starting April 24, 2015, was just called the Apple Watch. Or it was called ludicrously expensive, if you went for the gold-plated edtion.\r\n\r\nFast forward a year to September 2016, and suddenly the Apple Watch had numbers. Lots of them.\r\n\r\nThere was the brand-new Apple Watch Series 2, but also a revised version of the original, now called Apple Watch Series 1. The original original, the un-revised one, started to be known as the Series 0.\r\n\r\nAfter that, and to this day, there has been a new Apple Watch every year. It would be highly unusual if 2025 didn't see an Apple Watch Series 11 in September.\r\n\r\nIt would also be unusual if absolutely every year saw a major change, a truly major improvement in the Apple Watch. But such a change did happen with the Apple Watch Series 4 in 2018.\r\n\r\n\"Every bone in my body tells me this is very significant,\" Jony Ive said at the time. \"I'm so zealous about the Watch because I see it as making a material difference to people's quality of life and actually their ability to be alive.\"\r\n\r\nBy the time of the Apple Watch Series 4, Apple was seeing its role as very clearly one to do with health. Previously it might have been health, might have been fashion, and it might have been anything, but now Apple knew what it had.\r\n\r\nAnd it added an EKG to the Apple Watch Series 4. It has kept adding new health features ever since — or sometimes, it at least tried to.\r\n\r\nApple Watch's blood oxygen sensor\r\n\r\nOne of those health features concerned using light to measure blood oxygen levels. And in 2020, that prompted medical device manufacturer Masimo to sue Apple over the Apple Watch Series 6.\r\n\r\nThat case rumbled on until the subject was the Apple Watch Series 9, which was hit by an import ban in the US. Masimos versus Apple may never be sorted out, but in the meantime Apple has disabled that blood oxygen sensor — and Masimos's CEO has stepped down.\r\n\r\nBeyond the Apple Watch\r\n\r\nMasimo's legal challenge wasn't only about the Apple Watch Series 9. It also covered the Apple Watch Ultra.\r\n\r\nThe first version of that was launched in 2022, bringing with it a larger screen, greater waterproofing for divers — and an Action Button. That customizable physical button has since spread to the iPhone, but it began on the Apple Watch Ultra.\r\n\r\nWhile this larger model doesn't get updated every year, or at least not significantly, nor does the other newer entrant to the range. Apple Watch SE was launched even earlier than the Apple Watch Ultra, coming out in 2020 — and without any blood oxygen feature to trip it up in lawsuits.\r\n\r\nApple Watch Ultra looks cool. Or possibly evil.\r\n\r\nThat was less from trying to avoid legal hassles, and more to offer a cheaper Apple Watch while not cannibalizing sales from the regular Apple Watch.\r\n\r\nApple Watch Ultra is ostensibly aimed at rugged, outdoor sports people, and the Apple Watch SE is at least partly aimed at parents buying for their children. In practice, adults and coach-potatoes wear either, but Apple has at least spaced the models out at steadily higher price points.\r\n\r\nTen years on\r\n\r\nMaybe because a watch is such a personal device, but it does still feel as if the Apple Watch is a new product — until you see an Apple Watch Series 0 again. Today that original Watch seems impossibly small, practically unusably so, and it is limited.\r\n\r\nThe current Apple Watch Series 10 still needs you to have an iPhone. But where the iPhone was a crucial umbilical cord for the original Apple Watch, now it's far more possible to leave your phone behind and rely on your wrist-watch.\r\n\r\nBut that's not a casual use of the word \"rely,\" either. It's not rely on it in just the sense of being used to having it around.\r\n\r\nApple Watch SE 2\r\n\r\nInstead, Apple Watch is helping people watch their weight, and perhaps especially so since it is tightly-integrated into Apple Fitness+, which launched in 2020.\r\n\r\nAnd you need to read this. In 2021, AppleInsider's Mike Wuerthele wrote about the death of his daughter, and in a piece where you feel the howling anguish, he explains how this little Apple Watch device on his wrist helped him.\r\n\r\nIt's no Apple fan's enthusing, given that this piece was the third in a series about him being essentially forced to wear one.

It's a personal device making a difference in people's lives.\r\n\r\nWhatever comes next with the Apple Watch Series 11 and beyond, it is going to continue to be this. It's going to be health.\r\n\r\n\"If you zoom out into the future, and you look back, and you ask the question, 'What was Apple's greatest contribution to mankind?'\" said Tim Cook in 2019, \"it will be about health.\"", "tags": [14, 20, 21]}}, {"model": "blog.article", "pk": 185, "fields": {"title": "Get a free Apple Watch 'Global Close Your Rings Day' pin at retail stores", "author": "news@appleinsider.com (Amber Neely)", "description": "Celebrate \"Global Close Your Rings Day\" by earning Message app stickers and badges, a limited-time Apple Watch activity award, and score a commemorative pin at retail stores.April 24 is \"Global Close Your Rings Day\"April 24 is \"Global Close Your Rings Day,\" a…", "content": "<div class=\"article-body\">\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12 article-lede\">Celebrate \"Global Close Your Rings Day\" by earning Message app stickers and\r\n        badges, a limited-time <a href=\"https://appleinsider.com/inside/apple-watch\" title=\"Apple Watch\"\r\n            data-kpt=\"1\">Apple Watch</a> activity award, and score a commemorative pin at retail stores.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <div class=\" col-sm-12 align-center\">\r\n    </div>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">April 24 is \"Global Close Your Rings Day,\" and to celebrate, Apple is challenging users to get\r\n        up, get out, and close their rings.

It will instead be under the hardware division,\r\n        which is led by John Ternus.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">These moves haven't changed John Giannandrea's position as SVP of AI and ML at Apple, but it\r\n        indicates Apple CEO <a href=\"https://appleinsider.com/inside/tim-cook\" title=\"Tim Cook\" data-kpt=\"1\">Tim\r\n            Cook</a> is taking a different strategy with the refocus. It seems Giannandrea's team will build the\r\n        underlying models that will run future technologies, including the robots and Siri, but work independently of\r\n        the other teams.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">However, rumors from the sources providing these details suggest Cook could be planning a total\r\n        break-up of the AI and ML team. It could mean Giannandrea being assigned to a new position or leaving the\r\n        company altogether.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h2 class=\" col-sm-12\" data-anchor=\"rethinking-ai\" id=\"rethinking-ai\">Rethinking AI</h2>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">The motivations of these moves aren't known and can only be guessed at beyond the obvious\r\n        catalyst of the embarrassing AI delays. Cook could be trying to ensure Giannandrea and his team aren't spread\r\n        too thin while ensuring robotics hardware is prioritized and Siri is developed independently.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p

The Siri team moved to be placed under Mike Rockwell, the Apple Vision Pro chief.\r\n\r\nIt seems that wasn't the only internal move planned by Apple, as Bloomberg reports the robotics team is moving out from under the AI/ML organization. It will instead be under the hardware division, which is led by John Ternus.\r\n\r\nThese moves haven't changed John Giannandrea's position as SVP of AI and ML at Apple, but it indicates Apple CEO Tim Cook is taking a different strategy with the refocus. It seems Giannandrea's team will build the underlying models that will run future technologies, including the robots and Siri, but work independently of the other teams.\r\n\r\nHowever, rumors from the sources providing these details suggest Cook could be planning a total break-up of the AI and ML team. It could mean Giannandrea being assigned to a new position or leaving the company altogether.\r\n\r\nRethinking AI\r\n\r\nThe motivations of these moves aren't known and can only be guessed at beyond the obvious catalyst of the embarrassing AI delays. Cook could be trying to ensure Giannandrea and his team aren't spread too thin while ensuring robotics hardware is prioritized and Siri is developed independently.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the AI and ML team could be seen as redundant as Apple rethinks Apple Intelligence and its role at the company.

This will apparently appear when the iPad is attached to an accessory like the <a\r\n            href=\"https://appleinsider.com/inside/magic-keyboard\" title=\"Magic Keyboard\" data-kpt=\"1\">Magic\r\n            Keyboard</a>, for a more MacBook-like experience.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">Another operating system change for iPad is Stage Manager 2.0, Apple's system for managing\r\n        multiple apps at the same time. An enhanced multitasking mode will apparently activate when the Magic Keyboard\r\n        is attached, but other than saying it will make app management smoother, no other benefits are explained.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h2 class=\" col-sm-12\" data-anchor=\"ios-19-external-display-support\" id=\"ios-19-external-display-support\">iOS 19\r\n        external display support</h2>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">There will apparently also be changes arriving in iOS 19 to help with productivity, with the\r\n        main one apparently being external display support for iPhones with USB-C ports.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">Currently, you can mirror an <a href=\"https://appleinsider.com/inside/iphone\" title=\"iPhone\"\r\n            data-kpt=\"1\">iPhone</a> display on a monitor using a USB-C cable. According to the leaker, there will be a\r\n        Stage Manager-like interface this time around, which will let users extend their workspace to the second screen.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\"></p>\r\n    <br>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">Bu warns of potential limitations in resolution or apps that can run while displayed.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h2 class=\" col-sm-12\" data-anchor=\"dodgy-claims\" id=\"dodgy-claims\">Dodgy claims</h2>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">The rumors from Majin Bu should be taken with a pinch of salt, as they don't seem to be that\r\n        plausible. This is in part because of Bu's not exactly stellar reputation for accuracy, and a greater record of\r\n        reposting fabrications from social media as their own.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">Apple has long held the belief that the iPad and Mac are separate <a\r\n            href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/04/22/apple-reiterates-that-it-has-no-plans-to-merge-ipad-and-mac\">computing\r\n            experiences</a>. It seems improbable that a menu bar will be arriving in macOS, short of being shoehorned in\r\n        by an app, rather than as an OS change.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">The iPhone display extension also feels a bit out of place. While you could consider expanding\r\n        your work on an iPad, it seems less likely that anyone would do that with an iPhone, in part due to needing\r\n        accessories like a Bluetooth keyboard to make it more worthwhile.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">That said, there have been hints that Apple will be making some changes to its operating\r\n        systems.

According to the leaker, there will be a Stage Manager-like interface this time around, which will let users extend their workspace to the second screen.\r\n\r\nBu warns of potential limitations in resolution or apps that can run while displayed.\r\n\r\nDodgy claims\r\n\r\nThe rumors from Majin Bu should be taken with a pinch of salt, as they don't seem to be that plausible. This is in part because of Bu's not exactly stellar reputation for accuracy, and a greater record of reposting fabrications from social media as their own.\r\n\r\nApple has long held the belief that the iPad and Mac are separate computing experiences. It seems improbable that a menu bar will be arriving in macOS, short of being shoehorned in by an app, rather than as an OS change.\r\n\r\nThe iPhone display extension also feels a bit out of place. While you could consider expanding your work on an iPad, it seems less likely that anyone would do that with an iPhone, in part due to needing accessories like a Bluetooth keyboard to make it more worthwhile.\r\n\r\nThat said, there have been hints that Apple will be making some changes to its operating systems. In March, this was in the form of visionOS UI elements potentially making the jump from the Apple Vision Pro to Apple's other operating systems.\r\n\r\nIn April, there was a claim that iPadOS 19 could be more Mac-like for increased productivity, but stopped short of explaining what was on the way.", "tags": [21, 25, 29]}}, {"model": "blog.article", "pk": 188, "fields": {"title": "US will not tolerate EU fine against Apple, says White House", "author": "news@appleinsider.com (William Gallagher)", "description": "The White House has described the European Union's fining of Apple and Meta as extortion and called the Digital Markets Act discriminatory.The White House — image credit: White HouseWhen the EU fined Apple $570 million for alleged non-compliance with its Digi…", "content": "<div class=\"article-body\">\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12 article-lede\">The White House has described the European Union's fining of Apple and Meta as\r\n        extortion and called the Digital Markets Act discriminatory.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <div class=\" col-sm-12 align-center\">\r\n    </div>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">When the EU fined Apple <a\r\n            href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/04/23/eu-cuts-apple-anti-competition-fine-to-570-million-to-avoid-trump-retaliation\">$570\r\n            million</a> for alleged non-compliance with its Digital Markets Act (DMA), it came after reports the Union\r\n        was delaying its fines in order to appease Trump.

The iPhone 17 lineup expected in the fall could see significant price jumps depending on how Apple absorbs these costs.", "tags": [13, 21]}}, {"model": "blog.article", "pk": 191, "fields": {"title": "Apple's India supply chain expansion held back by Chinese tensions", "author": "news@appleinsider.com (Malcolm Owen)", "description": "Apple's supply chain diversification plans are rolling on, albeit slowly, with its expansion of iPhone production out of China and into India still running into stumbling blocks.Tim Cook in a previous visit to India — image credit: AppleApple is currently on …", "content": "<div class=\"article-body\">\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12 article-lede\">Apple's supply chain diversification plans are rolling on, albeit slowly, with its\r\n        expansion of <a href=\"https://appleinsider.com/inside/iphone\" title=\"iPhone\" data-kpt=\"1\">iPhone</a> production\r\n        out of China and into India still running into stumbling blocks.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <div class=\" col-sm-12 align-center\">\r\n    </div>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">Apple is currently on a multi-year journey to expand the reach of its supply chain.

It's always a pain when you change\r\n        Macs because, even with Apple's migration tools, there are still logins you've forgotten, preferences you don't\r\n        even realize you've ever changed, and so on.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">This time I got plenty of that and it was surely three weeks in before everything was\r\n        absolutely right again, but on day one, I had to make the move anyway.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">I was on deadline for the <em>AppleInsider</em> podcast, which is edited in Logic Pro. As\r\n        brilliant as that app is, it's also temperamental.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">Sometimes there are just days when I've had to cajole it into even starting up, and I cannot\r\n        fathom why, but at least I've got it down to a few minutes restarting and opening blank projects.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">Not that day. That day it was eventually possible to open Logic Pro but the smallest edit was\r\n        making my MacBook Pro beachball. It's definitely a storage issue as I have a peculiar <a\r\n            href=\"https://appleinsider.com/inside/icloud\" title=\"iCloud\" data-kpt=\"1\">iCloud</a> problem where it keeps\r\n        redownloading a particular file and then duplicating it, over and over.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <div class=\" col-sm-12 align-center\"><a\r\n            href=\"https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/63054-131713-888-CU-on-Mac-Studio-ports-xl.jpg\"\r\n            target=\"_blank\"><img\r\n                src=\"https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/63054-131713-888-CU-on-Mac-Studio-ports-xl.jpg\"\r\n                alt=\"Silver computer with three Thunderbolt ports and one Ethernet port, perforated bottom edge, and a minimalist design.\"\r\n                height=\"686\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img-responsive article-image\"></a>\r\n        <span class=\"carousel-caption\">Close up on some of the Mac Studio ports.

The difference\r\n        was a slap: Logic Pro boomed through the project and I really quickly made up the entire hour I'd lost trying to\r\n        get this going on the MacBook Pro.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">I've fixed Logic Pro on my MacBook Pro, but of course I edit everything audio on the Mac Studio\r\n        now. And not just audio, all video has switched over to my new Mac.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">The speed plus the fact that the Mac Studio stays on my desk means that I've actually changed\r\n        my whole system of making videos. Previously I was hand to mouth, shooting a video and editing it on the MacBook\r\n        Pro wherever I was, usually just in time for when it was due to go out.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">Now instead I tend to batch everything together, recording a few at time and spending my\r\n        weekends editing them all in Final Cut Pro on the Mac Studio.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">The speed of the Mac Studio is somehow responsible for me taking longer to shoot and produce\r\n        videos.

I produce magazines for a couple of charities in the UK and by very unfortunate fluke, the\r\n        deadlines for both their latest issues happened to fall in the same week.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">Consequently, that was a lot of mornings, evenings and weekends trying to race through\r\n        everything I had to do. If I'd been on my old Mac mini, I am certain that I would have done the lot on my\r\n        MacBook Pro just because it was faster.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">As it was, I of course did it all on the Mac Studio and on that, Affinity Publisher felt so\r\n        fast and responsive that I was skipping between the projects constantly. And then there was this part: my Mac\r\n        Studio has given me a Stream Deck renaissance.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">Not only am I now using my <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RL8H55Z?tag=aireviews-20\"\r\n            rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" data-orig-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RL8H55Z?tag=aireviews-20\"\r\n            data-ml-id=\"1\" data-ml=\"true\" data-xid=\"fr1746042732845jaa\">32-button Stream Deck XL</a> more than ever, I\r\n        also got out my previous <a\r\n            href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/06/13/elgato-stream-deck-review-a-mac-accessory-you-didnt-realize-you-need\">15-key\r\n            Stream Deck</a> and used it extensively.

It used to be a pain having a lot of\r\n        cables snaking around the desk, and I still do have that to an extent, but I don't even remember where I've put\r\n        that hub.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <div class=\" col-sm-12 align-center\"><a\r\n            href=\"https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/63054-131696-888-Mac-Studio-rear-ports-xl.jpg\"\r\n            target=\"_blank\"><img\r\n                src=\"https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/63054-131696-888-Mac-Studio-rear-ports-xl.jpg\"\r\n                alt=\"Computer ports with multiple cables connected; a silver metallic surface with ventilation holes is visible.\"\r\n                height=\"720\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img-responsive article-image\"></a>\r\n        <span class=\"carousel-caption\">The back is messy with cables, but there are so many ports on the Mac Studio that\r\n            it's replaced the dock I was using</span>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">The M4 Max Mac Studio has two 10 gigabit USB-C ports on the front and I've found I'm using them\r\n        a great deal. I'll plug in an <a\r\n            href=\"https://appleinsider.com/inside/mac/best/best-external-ssd-for-mac\">external drive</a> to transfer\r\n        video footage for editing, for instance, and I'll also connect the receiver for a wireless mic.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">Aside from those Stream Decks, some microphones and headphones, I've yet to consistently use\r\n        any other accessories. I plan to add an external drive because while Apple made me pay an arm and a leg for the\r\n        2TB storage I bought, it isn't enough.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">There is an SD card slot on the front of the Mac Studio and I've simply never used it, nor\r\n        really have any plans to.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">So apart from when I use the front USB-C ports to offload video from a little external drive,\r\n        or I connect a wireless mic receiver, the Mac Studio just sits there at the edge of my desk.\r\n    </p>\r\n    \r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">I would like it if the Mac Studio's headphone jack were on the front as well, the way it is on\r\n        the M4 Mac mini. When I'm editing or podcasting, I prefer over-ear headphones and I have to rotate the Mac\r\n        Studio to get to the jack plug for them.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">That's also why, after a month, I don't think I've settled on exactly where on my desk the Mac\r\n        Studio will stay. As well as with the headphones, I am quite often rotating it to plug in or remove USB-C and\r\n        USB-A cables, and having it where I can move it easily limits what I put on that side of the desk.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">I could do without the headphones in general use, and actually I realize now that I do. The\r\n        speaker in the Mac Studio isn't brilliant, but it's more than adequate for most general things I do on the Mac.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">There is a rule in my house that if you find a flat, empty surface, you put something on it.\r\n        But I can't do that with the Mac Studio, it's too nice and too expensive. It just feels wrong, just as it feels\r\n        wrong to tell you that I sometimes pat it.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\"><em>AppleInsider</em>'s Mike Wuerthele puts an old Superdrive on top of his. Some people have\r\n        no taste.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h2 class=\" col-sm-12\" data-anchor=\"mac-studio-m4-max-review-day-to-day-use\"\r\n        id=\"mac-studio-m4-max-review-day-to-day-use\">Mac Studio M4 Max review: day to day use</h2>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">My Mac Studio sits there on my desk remarkably quietly. I understand that there are fans inside\r\n        the Mac Studio but I'm practically taking this on trust, because I've never heard them, even when I'm hammering\r\n        on it with a video edit and Logic at the same time.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">And, not even on a weekend day when I was ten hours into publishing two magazines and editing a\r\n        series of Final Cut Pro videos simultaneously.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">I realize that I'm not a heavy <a href=\"https://appleinsider.com/inside/mac\" title=\"Mac\"\r\n            data-kpt=\"1\">Mac</a> user, at least not compared to scientists or even other video editors who work on\r\n        feature films or multiple streams of 8K footage at once.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">Even back in 2022 with the first Mac Studio, the <em>AppleInsider</em> concluded that there was\r\n        <a\r\n            href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/03/22/mac-studio-with-m1-uitra-review-a-look-at-the-future-power-of-apple-silicon\">more\r\n            performance</a> here than most users would need. Similarly, with the 2023 update, that Mac Studio edition\r\n        was clearly the <a\r\n            href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/06/14/mac-studio-2023-review-you-probably-want-this-and-not-the-mac-pro\">heir\r\n            apparent</a> for the \"Pro\" market, but you see those quote marks around the word.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">Each Mac Studio is capable of extraordinarily heavy lifting for the absolute most demanding\r\n        work, and it remains startlingly superior to the <a href=\"https://appleinsider.com/inside/mac-pro\"\r\n            title=\"Mac Pro\" data-kpt=\"1\">Mac Pro</a>.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">But rather than looking at this as how much a user like me needs performance, look at it as how\r\n        much that performance benefits even someone like me. There is no question that for the giant majority of Mac\r\n        users, the Mac Studio storms through everything.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">There is a question, though, over whether that matters enough to you. The Mac Studio, and\r\n        really any Mac at all, spends most of the time waiting on us, but there are jobs where it's the other way\r\n        around.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">If your work on any other Mac is taking a long time, and especially if that means you're losing\r\n        income because you can't get through the work quick enough, then the Mac Studio is worth the money. Whether or\r\n        not that's because you're an 8K video editing scientist modelling AI.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">This is really why I hesitated over spending all of this cash on the Mac Studio when I believed\r\n        I was getting along fine enough with my M1 Mac mini.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">But I am now so extraordinarily glad that I bought it. Things I didn't even appreciate were\r\n        slowing me down are now simply gone, and I think less about the Mac, more about the work.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <div class=\" col-sm-12 align-center\"><a\r\n            href=\"https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/63054-131697-888-Front-USB-ports-in-use-xl.jpg\"\r\n            target=\"_blank\"><img\r\n                src=\"https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/63054-131697-888-Front-USB-ports-in-use-xl.jpg\"\r\n                alt=\"Two USB devices, one silver and one black with an orange button, plugged into a silver surface with a narrow slot below.\"\r\n                height=\"720\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img-responsive article-image\"></a>\r\n        <span class=\"carousel-caption\">Using both of the front USB-C ports with (left) an external drive and (right) a\r\n            wireless microphone receiver</span>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">For example, while I was writing this, one of the charities emailed me with a tiny, tiny but\r\n        urgent change that was needed in their magazine. Before I had finished reading the sentence, Affinity Publisher\r\n        was open, I was making their change, and I vow that the whole job took under a minute.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">That's one minute including time to register what they wanted, figure out the solution,\r\n        implement it, export the PDF again and send it back to them.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">You can obviously say that was fast, but to me, it's not the speed per se that's the point. The\r\n        point is that my mind got to stay on the problem, I got to stay entirely focused on the task and the Mac Studio\r\n        simply gave me what I needed, as and when I needed it.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h2 class=\" col-sm-12\" data-anchor=\"mac-studio-m4-max-review-pros\" id=\"mac-studio-m4-max-review-pros\">Mac Studio M4\r\n        Max review: Pros</h2>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>Literal speed of the machine</li>\r\n        <li>Speed of how it means no distractions or delays</li>\r\n        <li>Silence</li>\r\n        <li>Enough ports to replace my old hub</li>\r\n        <li>Front-facing USB-C ports</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <h2 class=\" col-sm-12\" data-anchor=\"mac-studio-m4-max-review-cons\" id=\"mac-studio-m4-max-review-cons\">Mac Studio M4\r\n        Max review: Cons</h2>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>Headphone jack is inconveniently placed on the back</li>\r\n        <li>SSD and RAM upgrade pricing is borderline abusive</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">That headphone position is a genuine Con, but really just barely. For me and what I do, the Mac\r\n        Studio is transformative and unquestionably the best Mac I've ever used.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">Consequently, for me, it's an easy 5 out of 5 rating, but I have to be conscious of the fact\r\n        that it is an extremely expensive Mac. I felt the pain of handing over more than three grand, even if now it's\r\n        behind me.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">Plus as fast as I find this M4 Max Mac Studio, there is the <a\r\n            href=\"https://appleinsider.com/inside/m3\" title=\"M3\" data-kpt=\"1\">M3 Ultra</a> edition. That's even more\r\n        expensive, but for certain users, it's going to be the better buy.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"col-sm-12\">That's the only reason this Mac Studio has to have 4.5 out of 5.

What I look for, and what I've got with my Mac Studio, is an appreciable difference in my work.\r\n\r\nIn case you can read a spec sheet better than I can, though, let me tell you that I'm now using an M4 Max Mac Studio with 48GB RAM and 2TB SSD. It's replaced my office M1 Mac mini, which had 16GB RAM and 2TB SSD.\r\n\r\nI'm not surprised that it has replaced that Mac mini, since that was specifically why I bought it. But I am surprised that it has also gone a long way to replacing my M1 Max 14-inch MacBook Pro — and also significantly changed the way I work overall.\r\n\r\nFor some years now, if I needed to do a lot of work or it was something like video editing, I would do it on the MacBook Pro. I left more routine work, like admin and finances, to whenever I was next at my office Mac mini.\r\n\r\nAn M1 Mac mini (top) and the M4 Max Mac Studio that has replaced it (bottom)\r\n\r\nSince swapping out that machine for the Mac Studio, though, everything has changed. I'm not going to say that my MacBook Pro is now underused, but only because it would be upsetting.\r\n\r\nIt has become the second Mac, as well as of course the one I take away if I can't just rely on my iPad Pro. The Mac Studio is now my alpha Mac, and that is, perhaps obviously, because of its speed.\r\n\r\nMac Studio M4 Max review: changing workflows\r\n\r\nI had intended to quite gently move over to the Mac Studio. It's always a pain when you change Macs because, even with Apple's migration tools, there are still logins you've forgotten, preferences you don't even realize you've ever changed, and so on.\r\n\r\nThis time I got plenty of that and it was surely three weeks in before everything was absolutely right again, but on day one, I had to make the move anyway.\r\n\r\nI was on deadline for the AppleInsider podcast, which is edited in Logic Pro. As brilliant as that app is, it's also temperamental.\r\n\r\nSometimes there are just days when I've had to cajole it into even starting up, and I cannot fathom why, but at least I've got it down to a few minutes restarting and opening blank projects.\r\n\r\nNot that day. That day it was eventually possible to open Logic Pro but the smallest edit was making my MacBook Pro beachball. It's definitely a storage issue as I have a peculiar iCloud problem where it keeps redownloading a particular file and then duplicating it, over and over.\r\n\r\nClose up on some of the Mac Studio ports. All of mine are now filled.\r\n\r\nEven killing that file didn't help and so I turned to my shiny new Mac Studio. The difference was a slap: Logic Pro boomed through the project and I really quickly made up the entire hour I'd lost trying to get this going on the MacBook Pro.\r\n\r\nI've fixed Logic Pro on my MacBook Pro, but of course I edit everything audio on the Mac Studio now. And not just audio, all video has switched over to my new Mac.\r\n\r\nThe speed plus the fact that the Mac Studio stays on my desk means that I've actually changed my whole system of making videos. Previously I was hand to mouth, shooting a video and editing it on the MacBook Pro wherever I was, usually just in time for when it was due to go out.\r\n\r\nNow instead I tend to batch everything together, recording a few at time and spending my weekends editing them all in Final Cut Pro on the Mac Studio.\r\n\r\nThe speed of the Mac Studio is somehow responsible for me taking longer to shoot and produce videos. The result is better for it.\r\n\r\nMac Studio M4 Max review: unexpected changes\r\n\r\nAnd then there is this, which will not sound like it's anything to do with the Mac Studio, but it entirely is. I produce magazines for a couple of charities in the UK and by very unfortunate fluke, the deadlines for both their latest issues happened to fall in the same week.\r\n\r\nConsequently, that was a lot of mornings, evenings and weekends trying to race through everything I had to do. If I'd been on my old Mac mini, I am certain that I would have done the lot on my MacBook Pro just because it was faster.\r\n\r\nAs it was, I of course did it all on the Mac Studio and on that, Affinity Publisher felt so fast and responsive that I was skipping between the projects constantly. And then there was this part: my Mac Studio has given me a Stream Deck renaissance.\r\n\r\nNot only am I now using my 32-button Stream Deck XL more than ever, I also got out my previous 15-key Stream Deck and used it extensively. Typically you put an Elgato Stream Deck behind your keyboard and that's where my XL is, but the smaller one now lives by my left hand.\r\n\r\nSo it's Stream Deck, keyboard, trackpad. And the speed of the Stream Deck plus the speed of the Mac Studio meant that certain tasks I was doing a few hundred times on those magazines were flying. Think of it, tap the button, done.\r\n\r\nI know I just said I worked mornings, evenings and so on, but that was for a specific couple of weeks and overall — weirdly — my work/live balance has improved because of this Mac Studio. That seems insane to say, but having the speed, working through changing how I get things done, it has freed up some time that I'm now using to do that relaxing thing you read about.\r\n\r\nMac Studio M4 Max review: design\r\n\r\nI also used to have a hub plugged into the back of the Mac mini and already I don't remember why, since everything I have now just goes straight into the Mac Studio. It used to be a pain having a lot of cables snaking around the desk, and I still do have that to an extent, but I don't even remember where I've put that hub.\r\n\r\nThe back is messy with cables, but there are so many ports on the Mac Studio that it's replaced the dock I was using\r\n\r\nThe M4 Max Mac Studio has two 10 gigabit USB-C ports on the front and I've found I'm using them a great deal. I'll plug in an external drive to transfer video footage for editing, for instance, and I'll also connect the receiver for a wireless mic.\r\n\r\nAside from those Stream Decks, some microphones and headphones, I've yet to consistently use any other accessories. I plan to add an external drive because while Apple made me pay an arm and a leg for the 2TB storage I bought, it isn't enough.\r\n\r\nThere is an SD card slot on the front of the Mac Studio and I've simply never used it, nor really have any plans to.\r\n\r\nSo apart from when I use the front USB-C ports to offload video from a little external drive, or I connect a wireless mic receiver, the Mac Studio just sits there at the edge of my desk.\r\n\r\nI would like it if the Mac Studio's headphone jack were on the front as well, the way it is on the M4 Mac mini. When I'm editing or podcasting, I prefer over-ear headphones and I have to rotate the Mac Studio to get to the jack plug for them.\r\n\r\nThat's also why, after a month, I don't think I've settled on exactly where on my desk the Mac Studio will stay. As well as with the headphones, I am quite often rotating it to plug in or remove USB-C and USB-A cables, and having it where I can move it easily limits what I put on that side of the desk.\r\n\r\nI could do without the headphones in general use, and actually I realize now that I do. The speaker in the Mac Studio isn't brilliant, but it's more than adequate for most general things I do on the Mac.\r\n\r\nThere is a rule in my house that if you find a flat, empty surface, you put something on it. But I can't do that with the Mac Studio, it's too nice and too expensive. It just feels wrong, just as it feels wrong to tell you that I sometimes pat it.\r\n\r\nAppleInsider's Mike Wuerthele puts an old Superdrive on top of his. Some people have no taste.\r\n\r\nMac Studio M4 Max review: day to day use\r\n\r\nMy Mac Studio sits there on my desk remarkably quietly. I understand that there are fans inside the Mac Studio but I'm practically taking this on trust, because I've never heard them, even when I'm hammering on it with a video edit and Logic at the same time.\r\n\r\nAnd, not even on a weekend day when I was ten hours into publishing two magazines and editing a series of Final Cut Pro videos simultaneously.\r\n\r\nI realize that I'm not a heavy Mac user, at least not compared to scientists or even other video editors who work on feature films or multiple streams of 8K footage at once.\r\n\r\nEven back in 2022 with the first Mac Studio, the AppleInsider concluded that there was more performance here than most users would need. Similarly, with the 2023 update, that Mac Studio edition was clearly the heir apparent for the \"Pro\" market, but you see those quote marks around the word.\r\n\r\nEach Mac Studio is capable of extraordinarily heavy lifting for the absolute most demanding work, and it remains startlingly superior to the Mac Pro.\r\n\r\nBut rather than looking at this as how much a user like me needs performance, look at it as how much that performance benefits even someone like me. There is no question that for the giant majority of Mac users, the Mac Studio storms through everything.\r\n\r\nThere is a question, though, over whether that matters enough to you. The Mac Studio, and really any Mac at all, spends most of the time waiting on us, but there are jobs where it's the other way around.\r\n\r\nIf your work on any other Mac is taking a long time, and especially if that means you're losing income because you can't get through the work quick enough, then the Mac Studio is worth the money. Whether or not that's because you're an 8K video editing scientist modelling AI.\r\n\r\nThis is really why I hesitated over spending all of this cash on the Mac Studio when I believed I was getting along fine enough with my M1 Mac mini.\r\n\r\nBut I am now so extraordinarily glad that I bought it. Things I didn't even appreciate were slowing me down are now simply gone, and I think less about the Mac, more about the work.\r\n\r\nUsing both of the front USB-C ports with (left) an external drive and (right) a wireless microphone receiver\r\n\r\nFor example, while I was writing this, one of the charities emailed me with a tiny, tiny but urgent change that was needed in their magazine. Before I had finished reading the sentence, Affinity Publisher was open, I was making their change, and I vow that the whole job took under a minute.\r\n\r\nThat's one minute including time to register what they wanted, figure out the solution, implement it, export the PDF again and send it back to them.\r\n\r\nYou can obviously say that was fast, but to me, it's not the speed per se that's the point. The point is that my mind got to stay on the problem, I got to stay entirely focused on the task and the Mac Studio simply gave me what I needed, as and when I needed it.\r\n\r\nMac Studio M4 Max review: Pros\r\n\r\nLiteral speed of the machine\r\n\r\nSpeed of how it means no distractions or delays\r\n\r\nSilence\r\n\r\nEnough ports to replace my old hub\r\n\r\nFront-facing USB-C ports\r\n\r\nMac Studio M4 Max review: Cons\r\n\r\nHeadphone jack is inconveniently placed on the back\r\n\r\nSSD and RAM upgrade pricing is borderline abusive\r\n\r\nThat headphone position is a genuine Con, but really just barely. For me and what I do, the Mac Studio is transformative and unquestionably the best Mac I've ever used.\r\n\r\nConsequently, for me, it's an easy 5 out of 5 rating, but I have to be conscious of the fact that it is an extremely expensive Mac. I felt the pain of handing over more than three grand, even if now it's behind me.\r\n\r\nPlus as fast as I find this M4 Max Mac Studio, there is the M3 Ultra edition. That's even more expensive, but for certain users, it's going to be the better buy.\r\n\r\nThat's the only reason this Mac Studio has to have 4.5 out of 5. Though note that I now join another AppleInsider user in knowing that the Mac Studio is the one to get, if you possibly can.\r\n\r\nWhere to buy Apple's 2025 Mac Studio at up to $987 off\r\n\r\nWhatever configuration of Apple's 2025 Mac Studio is right for you is marked down in the AppleInsider Mac Studio Price Guide.

Turley admits that they've never been able to discuss concrete terms with Samsung, partly\r\n                because Google now pays the Korean manufacturer to pre-install its Gemini AI app. Thus, by acquiring\r\n                Chrome, OpenAI would suddenly gain direct access to billions of users.</font>\r\n        </font>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p></p>\r\n   \r\n    <p>\r\n        <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\r\n            <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">But obviously, there's a downside to this, because replacing one\r\n                giant with another is just a change of master. The data collection needed to power these AIs raises\r\n                serious questions about our privacy. And especially how would OpenAI use our browsing data? What would\r\n                their privacy policies be?

Et pas n’importe comment !! Ils le veulent uniquement si la justice américaine force Google à s’en séparer suite à ce fameux procès antitrust qui a déclaré Google comme détenteur d’un monopole illégal sur la recherche web.\r\n\r\n(Roooh, oui j’y vais un peu fort c’est vrai…)\r\n\r\nMais quand même, voir la boîte derrière ChatGPT se jeter sur un navigateur utilisé par 4 milliards de personnes et représentant 67% du marché, ça mérite qu’on s’y attarde un peu. Surtout quand leur big chef, Nick Turley, déclare sans tortiller du cul devant le tribunal que : “Ouiiiii, nous serions intéressés par le rachat de Chrome, tout comme de nombreuses autres morceaux (de Google).”\r\n\r\nEn gros, cette histoire a commencé quand un juge fédéral américain, Amit Mehta, a statué que Google avait un monopole illégal sur la recherche en ligne. Le Département de Justice américain (DOJ) demande depuis peu des mesures sérieuses, dont la vente forcée de Chrome et le juge doit rendre sa décision finale d’ici août 2025.\r\n\r\nPendant ce temps, OpenAI ne reste pas les bras croisés car ils ont déjà recruté d’anciens développeurs de Chrome (Ben Goodger et Darin Fisher) et auraient même envisagé de créer leur propre navigateur basé sur Chromium. leur stratégie est claire, ils veulent une place centrale dans notre navigation quotidienne.\r\n\r\nMais qu’est-ce que ça donnerait concrètement, un “Chrome by OpenAI” ?\r\n\r\nEt bien selon Turley, ce serait une “expérience vraiment incroyable” (tu m’étonnes…lol) avec une approche “AI-first”. En gros un navigateur qui comprend réellement ce que vous cherchez au lieu de vous balancer 15 résultats sponso.\r\n\r\nPar exemple, vous demandez un bon resto japonais pas cher dans votre quartier, et au lieu d’une liste de liens, vous obtenez directement la réponse avec les menus, les avis, les photos, et même une suggestion de plats selon vous goûts précédemment enregistrés. L’IA pourrait aussi automatiser pas mal de trucs chiants comme remplir des formulaires, résumer les articles trop longs de mon site, traduire instantanément des pages, ou même interagir avec des sites à votre place.\r\n\r\n“ChatGPT, réserve-moi ce vol pour Barcelone” et hop, le machin s’occupe de tout.\r\n\r\nCôté business, OpenAI galère actuellement avec la distribution de ses services. Ils ont réussi à s’intégrer dans les iPhone d’Apple, mais sur Android, c’est la misère. Turley avoue qu’ils n’ont jamais pu discuter de termes concrets avec Samsung, notamment parce que Google paie désormais le fabricant coréen pour préinstaller son application Gemini AI. Ainsi, en mettant la main sur Chrome, OpenAI gagnerait d’un coup un accès direct à des milliards d’utilisateurs.\r\n\r\nMais évidemment, il y a un revers à la médaille car remplacer un géant par un autre, c’est juste changer de maître. La collecte de données nécessaire pour alimenter ces IA pose des questions sérieuses sur notre vie privée. Et surtout comment OpenAI utiliserait nos données de navigation ? Quelles seraient leurs politiques de confidentialité ? Sans parler de l’avenir des milliers d’extensions Chrome existantes ??\r\n\r\nIl existe également une 3e voie : Transformer Chrome en entreprise indépendante.\r\n\r\nMais Google soutient que son navigateur ne pourrait pas survivre seul, ce qui est douteux quand on sait que les contrats de placement de recherche (que Google paie à Apple et autres) se chiffrent en milliards.\r\n\r\nBref, d’un côté, l’intégration de l’IA dans notre usage quotidien d’Internet va nous faciliter la vie et nous rendre encore plus productif pour servir au mieux le grand Capital, mais du côté du respect de la vie privée, et surtout de la survie d’un web ouvert à tous, ça craint un peu.\r\n\r\nSi OpenAI mettait la main sur Chrome, ce serait donc une sacrée révolution mais aussi une sacrée malédiction. En attendant la décision du juge en août, pourquoi ne pas tester l’extension ChatGPT déjà disponible pour Chrome (ou Firefox !) et voir ce que ça donne ? Ou mieux encore, essayer des alternatives comme Firefox, Brave ou Arc, histoire de ne pas mettre tous ses œufs dans le même panier “algorithmique”.\r\n\r\nSource", "tags": [1, 13, 26]}}, {"model": "blog.article", "pk": 202, "fields": {"title": "You can still get the free pin at the Apple Store.

Este año, el Apple Watch cumple diez años y Apple lo celebra por todo lo alto repartiendo un pin especial que puedes conseguir fácilmente. Y sí, hasta Tim Cook se ha sumado a la fiesta en redes sociales. Y es que detrás de esos tres círculos de colores hay auténticas historias de superación, de competición sana y de pequeñas rutinas que, sin darnos cuenta, han cambiado nuestra salud.\r\n\r\nEste año, Apple ha decidido celebrar estas diez vueltas al sol con un gesto sencillo pero que hace mucha ilusión: regalar un pin físico para conmemorar el décimo aniversario del Apple Watch. Un detalle que materializa todos esos premios y pin digitales que completamos al finalizar nuestro primer entreno, una buena racha... ¿Cómo conseguir este bonito recuerdo de Apple? Te lo contamos.\r\n\r\nDiez años moviéndonos y cerrando anillos\r\n\r\nDesde aquel 24 de abril de 2015, el Apple Watch ha ido evolucionando e incorporando nuevas funciones pensadas para cuidarnos: sensores más avanzados, medición de sueño... Pero si algo ha permanecido (casi) igual, son los famosísimos anillos de actividad. Movimiento, ejercicio y de pie: tres objetivos diarios, sencillos y tremendamente efectivos.\r\n\r\n¿Cómo conseguir el pin del Apple Watch?\r\n\r\nEs tan fácil como acercarte a cualquier Apple Store a partir del 24 de abril y pedirlo en persona. No necesitas demostrar que has cerrado tus anillos ese día, ni que llevas una década usando el reloj. Eso sí: el pin es de edición limitada, así que será para los primeros que lo soliciten, hasta agotar existencias. Tal y como indica Apple:\r\n\r\nPodrán recoger este pin en las Apple Store de todo el mundo a partir del 24 de abril, hasta fin de existencias.\r\n\r\nBusca tu Apple Store más cercana y ve a por él como ya han hecho muchos. El pin reproduce el diseño de la medalla digital de la app Fitness: los tres anillos de actividad entrelazados, convertidos ya en todo un símbolo del compromiso con la salud y el movimiento.\r\n\r\nNuestra experiencia recogiendo el pin en la Apple Store\r\n\r\nNada más conocer la acción de Apple por el Día Mundial de Cerrar los Anillos hemos ido a por el coche y puesto rumbo a la Apple Store. En mi caso, la de Zaragoza. No todos los días se puede entrar en una Apple Store y decir que te van a regalar algo, ¿verdad? La tienda estaba tranquila, y primero me puse por la zona del Apple Watch para ver si se veían. Obviamente no estaban a la vista, pero justo una mujer que estaba comprando un Apple Watch se lo habían entregado junto a su compra. ¡Uf menos mal! Eran las seis de la tarde del jueves 24 y todavía quedaban. Por lo que seguramente en algunas tiendas sigan quedando unidades para el viernes 25 de abril.\r\n\r\nApple Store de Zaragoza\r\n\r\nMe dirigí al chico que suele estar en la puerta, y le pregunté: ¿os quedan todavía pins del Apple Watch? ¡Sí claro, cuántos quieres! ¿Uno? ¿Dos? En teoría es uno por persona, yo iba acompañado. Así que me he hecho con dos. La disponibilidad dependerá de la ciudad, pero siendo jueves en Zaragoza seguramente queden para días posteriores. En otras, como Madrid o Barcelona quizás sea más complicado. Por lo que la recomendación es ir a probar suerte cuanto antes.\r\n\r\nLa bolsa de cartón protege el pin\r\n\r\nEl pin viene en una bolsa de cartón para protegerlo, y una vez lo sacas viene también en un cartón rígido. Brilla, es de metal y tiene relieve. Pero lo que más hace ilusión es tener esta pieza única que pocas veces llegan al público en general. En eventos como la WWDC o si visita el Apple Park sí que se tiene acceso a este tipo de merchandising. Pero para alguien normal y corriente, como yo desde Zaragoza, esta es una ocasión que hace especial ilusión.\r\n\r\nLa celebración ha llegado también a las redes sociales. Tim Cook, CEO de Apple, ha publicado un vídeo en X desde el propio Apple Park, animando a todo el mundo a sumarse al reto. No importa si hoy te toca pilates, running o simplemente un paseo por el parque: lo importante es moverse, disfrutar… y compartir el logro con la comunidad.\r\n\r\nAsí que este 24 de abril tienes una excusa (más) para moverte. Ganar el pin digital, y si tienes una Apple Store cerca, conseguir un pin físico. Algo único y exclusivo de Apple que solo unos pocos podrán tener en sus manos. Un pequeño homenaje para recordar todo lo que han cambiado estos diez años y celebrar que la vida es movimiento.\r\n\r\nFuente | Apple\r\n\r\nEn Applesfera | Cómo pausar los anillos de actividad en el Apple Watch\r\n\r\nEn Applesfera | Apnea del sueño en Apple Watch: qué es, cómo se detecta y cómo debe tratarse", "tags": [14, 21]}}, {"model": "blog.article", "pk": 208, "fields": {"title": "Si quieres un buen mando para jugar con tu iPhone, no hace falta gastarse un dineral.

This tool leverages artificial intelligence to automatically balance exposure, light and shadows, and black-and-white levels. According to Skylum, it’s meant to deliver optimal visual results with minimal manual tweaking. However, the feature is limited to Pro subscribers and Upgrade Pass holders.\r\n\r\nCatalog Cache Cleaning Optimizes Performance\r\n\r\nTo address performance concerns raised by users, the update introduces a Catalog Cache Cleaning feature. Found in the Preferences menu, this tool helps clear temporary cache files created while working with large catalogs. The company says this should significantly improve the application’s speed and responsiveness.\r\n\r\nAtmosphere AI Gets Realistic Fog Effects\r\n\r\nThe Atmosphere AI tool also sees a significant improvement.

I&#8217;d really wanted a site like that\r\n    for years, with a grid of project videos that smoothly transitioned into detail pages, but never felt confident\r\n    about pulling it off. Then I found the <a\r\n        href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API\">View Transitions API</a>. Despite\r\n    its shortcomings (i.e. no interruption handling), it felt like the perfect tool for the job. View Transitions using\r\n    snapshots of &#8220;old&#8221; views seemed perfect for the video grid, and meant I wouldn&#8217;t have to worry\r\n    about animating a bunch of <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> elements at the same time. Ultimately, I had to use a few more\r\n    tricks to get decent performance during the transitions, but I still can&#8217;t imagine having built the site with\r\n    anything else. I was honored when Googlers <a\r\n        href=\"https://x.com/addyosmani/status/1778206854243660275?lang=en\">Addy Osmani</a> and <a\r\n        href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-6LgEjEyzE\">Una Kravets</a> shared my little site as a demo for View\r\n    Transitions.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https://musee.barvian.me\">Musée</a></h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\">\r\n    <div class=\"video-wrapper\">\r\n        <video autoplay loop muted\r\n            src=\"https://codrops-1f606.kxcdn.com/codrops/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/musee.mp4?x19156\"\r\n            playsinline></video>\r\n    </div>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I stumbled upon this <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/shots/14281766-Ancient-Art-Museum-Landing-Page\">incredible\r\n        design</a> by Kevin Pham on Dribbble a couple years ago and immediately fell in love with it. I had wanted to\r\n    experiment with CSS Scroll Snapping and 3D scenes for a while, and this seemed like the perfect candidate. I ended\r\n    up using React Three Fiber, Motion for React, and Tailwind to implement it. It&#8217;s not perfect (there&#8217;s a\r\n    pesky bug with mobile Safari on the last slide that I haven&#8217;t been able to fix), but I&#8217;m pretty happy\r\n    with how it turned out.

I didn&#8217;t want to bring those issues into my plugin, so I spent a whole Sunday watching\r\n    math videos on YouTube and talking to my physicist brother to figure out how to work around them. I eventually\r\n    published the results in <a\r\n        href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2023/11/addressing-accessibility-concerns-fluid-type/\">Smashing\r\n        Magazine</a> with some help from their great editors there, and was honored to see Adrian Roselli reference the\r\n    work in his original article. <a href=\"https://utopia.fyi/\">Utopia</a>, a popular fluid clamp generator, also\r\n    integrated the findings into their tool.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">About me</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I got into creative development in a 7th grade journalism class, when my teacher made me the webmaster for our school\r\n    newspaper.

I&#8217;ve since moved on from Dreamweaver 🙂, but I&#8217;ve never wanted to do anything else professionally.\r\n    I feel lucky that I&#8217;ve been able to make a career out of my passion.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Current challenges</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>At Clerk I&#8217;m working on building the component library we use for our dashboard.

All the animations are powered by the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API\">Web Animations API</a> (WAAPI). It uses the <a href=\"https://aerotwist.com/blog/flip-your-animations/\">FLIP technique</a>, <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSS/registerProperty_static\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">registered custom CSS properties</a>, spring-based <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/easing-function/linear\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><code>linear()</code></a> timings, new <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mod\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">CSS math functions</a>, and <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyframeEffect/composite\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">composited <code>KeyframeEffect</code>s</a> for better interruption handling.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The response to NumberFlow has been surreal. 𝕏 is currently using it for their analytics dashboard, and Elon Musk even retweeted this screenshot of it:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The time has finally come.

I&#8217;d really wanted a site like that for years, with a grid of project videos that smoothly transitioned into detail pages, but never felt confident about pulling it off. Then I found the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API\">View Transitions API</a>. Despite its shortcomings (i.e. no interruption handling), it felt like the perfect tool for the job. View Transitions using snapshots of &#8220;old&#8221; views seemed perfect for the video grid, and meant I wouldn&#8217;t have to worry about animating a bunch of <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> elements at the same time. Ultimately, I had to use a few more tricks to get decent performance during the transitions, but I still can&#8217;t imagine having built the site with anything else. I was honored when Googlers <a href=\"https://x.com/addyosmani/status/1778206854243660275?lang=en\">Addy Osmani</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-6LgEjEyzE\">Una Kravets</a> shared my little site as a demo for View Transitions.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https://musee.barvian.me\">Musée</a></h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video autoplay loop muted src=\"https://codrops-1f606.kxcdn.com/codrops/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/musee.mp4?x19156\" playsinline></video></figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I stumbled upon this <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/shots/14281766-Ancient-Art-Museum-Landing-Page\">incredible design</a> by Kevin Pham on Dribbble a couple years ago and immediately fell in love with it. I had wanted to experiment with CSS Scroll Snapping and 3D scenes for a while, and this seemed like the perfect candidate. I ended up using React Three Fiber, Motion for React, and Tailwind to implement it. It&#8217;s not perfect (there&#8217;s a pesky bug with mobile Safari on the last slide that I haven&#8217;t been able to fix), but I&#8217;m pretty happy with how it turned out. I was honored when <a href=\"https://x.com/rauchg\">Guillermo Rauch</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/0xca0a\">Paul Henschel</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/mattgperry\">Matt Perry</a>, and <a href=\"https://x.com/threejs\">Three.js</a> all reposted it.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2023/11/addressing-accessibility-concerns-fluid-type/://musee.barvian.me\">Fluid type projects</a></h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video autoplay loop muted src=\"https://codrops-1f606.kxcdn.com/codrops/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fluidstyle.mov?x19156\" playsinline></video></figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This work is probably the most boring on the list but I&#8217;m still happy with it. I was working on a <a href=\"https://fluid.tw/\">Tailwind plugin for CSS <code>clamp()</code></a> when I encountered some <a href=\"https://adrianroselli.com/2019/12/responsive-type-and-zoom.html\">longstanding accessibility issues with fluid type</a>. I didn&#8217;t want to bring those issues into my plugin, so I spent a whole Sunday watching math videos on YouTube and talking to my physicist brother to figure out how to work around them. I eventually published the results in <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2023/11/addressing-accessibility-concerns-fluid-type/\">Smashing Magazine</a> with some help from their great editors there, and was honored to see Adrian Roselli reference the work in his original article. <a href=\"https://utopia.fyi/\">Utopia</a>, a popular fluid clamp generator, also integrated the findings into their tool.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">About me</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I got into creative development in a 7th grade journalism class, when my teacher made me the webmaster for our school newspaper. I asked my parents for Dreamweaver that year for Christmas and got my first freelance client a year after that. I&#8217;ve since moved on from Dreamweaver 🙂, but I&#8217;ve never wanted to do anything else professionally. I feel lucky that I&#8217;ve been able to make a career out of my passion.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Current challenges</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>At Clerk I&#8217;m working on building the component library we use for our dashboard. It&#8217;s been a fun challenge to try to build something that equally emphasizes UX and DX! I hope to share more <a href=\"https://x.com/MBarvian\">on 𝕏</a> as it progresses. <a href=\"https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/components.html\">React Aria Components</a> has been a huge inspiration here.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tools</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I basically live in VS Code writing React, Tailwind, and <a href=\"https://motion.dev/\">Motion</a> code all day.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Philosophy</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/verse_/status/1861991773276344394\">Someone I follow on 𝕏</a> thought NumberFlow was a good example of a quote by Charlie Munger:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\r\n<p>&#8220;Take a simple idea and take it seriously.&#8221;<br>—Charlie Munger</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>That&#8217;s stuck with me over the last few months, and I think it&#8217;s increased my enjoyment of projects I previously would&#8217;ve dismissed as too routine or boring.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>It&#8217;s an honor to be featured on a site I&#8217;ve been reading my whole career.
